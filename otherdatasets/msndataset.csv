So far we are very pleased. Much better timing, braking, accelerating, AWD is impeccable, same interior space is great, new exterior design is excellent, new features on the inside are much improved. Overall a great choice. Hopefully we don't encounter problems as we did with the 2008 - however, GMC is willing to stand by their product. We purchased the extended bumper to bumper warranty to 60,000 miles, and if we don't use the deductible to fix anything between the end of the manufacture bumper to bumper and the extended period, we get the entire amount back. ","Spacious, AWD performance is impeccable.

The cab is bigger but still not as big as the ford but the seats in the gmc are more comfortable. The fit and finish is good and the materials they are using are great. The new screen and the Nav are a huge improvement. I think overall knowing how nice the F150 is and how awesome the ecoboost is has clouded my opinion of the new gmc and I think even with a dated body stlye the ford is still the better truck.. I dont mind driving it but I will be foaming at the mouth when ford does their redesign on the F150 ","Like the look of the truck and some of the features inside the cabin. The Sierra is very quiet but does have a rattle in the instrument cluster that is driving me crazy. I traded a 2011 f150 platinum ecoboost which I liked very much! So far I have had my Sierra for 2 months and miss my ecoboost there is no comparison to the low end torque that you get from the ecoboost. i should have waited for the 6.2 v8 but I wanted the fuel economy. 
","Fuel economy, rattle in the dash, lack of rear vent for climate. HP and torque are better than the old 5.3 but dont hold a candle to the F150's ecoboost (will be trading for the redesigned f150 or the atlas in 2015)I have got 16 in town but on our first trip best hwy mpg i got was 15.6mpg

The 6.2 liter v8 is a monster. The thoughtful touches like LED lights under the bed rails and in the storage bin and the remote start via cell phone feature make this truck stand apart from its competitors. ","I drove a 2013 Toyota Tundra crew cab. I bought the crew cab SLE 6.2 liter configuration. The GMC is MUCH more refined. It's quieter and more composed. The motor is a dream. It's very responsive and feels much faster than Toyota's 5.7 liter. The interior is much classier than the Toyota's. The interior surfaces are very soft and the quality is very evident. The touchscreen interface is easy to use and very informative. The 110 standard home plug on the dash is VERY handy. There's also thoughtful touches like LED lights under the bed rails and in the center storage bin. Lastly, the remote start and ability to start the truck via cellphone is a touchdown. 
","It's minor, but even though the rear seating area on the GMC is larger for 2014 and very adequately sized, it's not as large as the Toyota. Also, it doesn't have vents. That's the only two advantages the Toyota has over the GMC.

We pull trailers making deliveries in the western US Our loads vary from 2500 lbs to a trailer and load weight of over 24,000 lbs. The Duramax engine and Allision transmission work very well for us. Our 2013 has the engine brake plus the factory mounted brake controller and works very well and the engine brake adds a lot of security to the driver at is helps hold back the pickup when going down hills and having a loaded 24' gooseneck trailer giving a push. I really like the onstar features such as having its own phone number, should not drop calls or have the battery go dead, problems with cell phones. 
","My dislikes about the pick up are mostly, when pulling a load it gets quite thirsty. But the 2013 seems to get 2-3 miles per gallon that the 2008 and 2005 GMC diesel pickups we have used.

The remote start is a nice feature and I appreciate the initiation of the AC in the summer months. My pioneer system is nice, but I do prefer I little more bump in my trunk!

I adjusted the front driver seat comfortable for me, then sat in the back seats to see how my clients would feel. VERY roomy in the back seat, even while I was very comfortable in the front. We also looked at the Acadia, which offers more room overall. However, the back seats in the Acadia weren't nearly as comfortable or spacious as the Terrain. The back seats fold down very easy, allowing for plenty of room for my signs, etc. I love the dash with all of it's controls (touch screen). I've only had this car for 2 weeks and am loving it more and more every day! 
","What others say about the roof pillars (area between front/back doors) creating blind spots is true. However, you just learn to look a bit closer. The back up camera is handy, but doesn't take the place of looking both ways. I also noticed, while washing it (and my husbands' Honda) that the bumpers, etc are much more plastic feeling than what I'm used to. Hitting a curb or a big pot hole will probably cause more body damage than my previous vehicles. I also miss the dual climate controls (front and back), but the AC cools things down quickly.

I have a white Terrain and it looks very elegant, the front looks like a truck but drives like a car. So many features inside, can't go wrong with Satellite and Onstar. Is like driving in a cockpit. It is a V4 so if you live around hills, this is NOT the car for you. Not strong when getting into highways but from a V6 to a V4 it pays off, gas miles is good for me but don't go by the sticker. So if you like GMC and your pockets are in pain from gas prices, then get this car, only if you live in a flat environment with no hills or mountains. 
","Beware when driving with the rear windows down. You will experience ear pressure and a loud noise that you will need to close up the windows again. After I got the car I went online and this is a problem the Terrain has and GMC is aware of it.

It reminds me of the classic station-wagon, a sadly defunct class of cars that were a good compromise between a sedan and a van.Don't expect sports sedan handling or acceleration. Expect competent handling and reasonable gas millage. ","Rides well over some of the worst roads in California. Road noise is there, but not intrusive even on grooved cement freeways. V6 has decent acceleration and pulls hills just fine. Comfortable front seats and the rear seat has great legroom. Controls are well laid out and it has 4 12v outlets inside, great for all those chargers. 1000 mile days on vacation were doable.Handling is crisp for this size of vehicle, brakes are strong and don't fade, even down the notorious Grapevine in SOCAL.Visibility is a bit limited out the sides and back, but not as bad as some others we drove in the same class. Out the front the relatively tall seating height gives a commanding view of the road ahead. 
","Better rear ventilation would be nice, the 100+ days can leave the rear seat a little stuffy if you don't crank up the fan. Body roll is well controlled... until it is not. Around town it seem impossible to fluster the traction control, even when flooring it and making a right turn up a steep hill. However, taking a curve a little to fast at 2 lane highway speeds or freeway speeds takes the normally surefooted handling and makes it squirrelly and the body roll becomes pronounced. The edge of the envelope seems to be a pretty sharp drop off. Never had a car with active traction control, so perhaps this is normal.

Test drive the other vehicles in this class just so your mind is at ease when you decide to purchase the Terrain! Didn't drive the Hyundai or Kia so maybe take a look at those just in case. The CR-V was easily the most uncomfortable vehicle I have ever had the displeasure of sitting in and we sat in 2 of them that were used, so they should have been broken in. Both my wife and I drive 40 minutes to work each day, so having a comfortable vehicle was key and we found it with the Terrain. ","Really like how the Terrain rides and this was most comfortable vehicle in this class, at least out of what my wife and I drove. We drove the CR-V, Rav4, CX 5, Rogue, and even tried out the Highlander. We really liked the CX 5 but settled on the SLE-2 4 cylinder AWD Terrain and love it. We do mostly highway driving and are getting right around 26 MPG. I did also manage to get 31.5 MPG over a 50 mile stretch so we are quite pleased. The cabin is quiet compared to most vehicles. The rear seat can slide all the way up to the back of the front seat for more rear cargo space. Good sound system (Pioneer). Also, really like the back-up camera. Heated seats are a must have in Minnesnowta! 
","I haven't developed any dislikes for the Terrain yet. Only thing that has caught me maybe once is that there is a chrome piece around the shifter that if the sun hits it right it almost blinds you. This isn't a major issue.... just couldn't think of much that is negative about this vehicle. If you want something a little most zippy then get the CX 5. Terrain doesn't take off super fast, but I also leave it in ECO MODE which changes the shift points so it is most likely my own fault that it doesn't take off quickly. Once again, had to think for awhile to find something negative...

Accord has more Pros than Cons.I will recommend Accord at anytime to my dear ones. ","1. Overall Quality, Performance, Instrument Panel and Design: When I compared Camry as long as interior design concerned, Camry is nowhere closer to Accord. Dashboard Design is awesome, Big screen is mind blowing (non touch screen though) but position and layout is very cool.2. Comfort: I felt Both Cars are same ( Honda has more cabin space.3. Features and Style: Style doesn’t have any measurement and it goes by individual perception. Accord has lots of bells and whistles, chrome plating looks cool and car style and ride quality is aggressive. 4. Fuel Economy: Second best in midsize car and fortunately true.7. Safety and Resale Value: Accord is best in midsize segment if you see stats. 
","1. 60/40: In Accord Rear Seat not 60/40 split, never mind I don’t use that frequently.2. Audio: Car Audio quality is good but not great.3. Trunk space: Not impressed with layout as older cars has low bed, big opening and better shape to fit 3 check-in bags but new shape is not efficient even though Camry and Accord has biggest cargo space.4. Reliability in log run: hmm when I went through car complaints, I saw lot of issues reported but ~90% complaints were related to Seat comfort and Audio connection in old Accords, Don’t worry and trust your luck.Even my Camry has engine down (May be I got lemon) still Honda and Toyota are very reliable cars at least KBB and JD Power says that.

Plus, the residual heat from the turbo makes the wiring harnesses and rubber hoses brittle after a few years. ","I think it's the best bang for the buck.

The fit and finish is very improved over past models. Braking is also very good. Was considering some German models, but frankly the Honda reliability won me over. We will use the car to travel in retirement, so fuel economy and ride was important. But we also still enjoy driving a car, so the manual tranny was a must and transforms the base 4 cylinder into fun vehicle if you are willing to rev when needed, though this Honda 4 cyliinder does seem to have more low end (when not in eco mode) than their previous ones . It is a solid workhorse that you can still have some fun with that just gets the job done. Overall it has exceeded our expectations as it wears so many hats so well. And, for a little over 20 grand, I think it is one of the best bargains out there. ","Bought the base model sedan with a 6 speed manual tranny. Acceleration with the 4 cylinder is less than 7 seconds to 60 mph -. Was looking for a vehicle capable of being the family hauler, decent highway ride, good fuel economy, and still sporty - a ""sleeper."" Very good highway fuel mileage - around 35 mpg. The ""eco"" mode makes less power available ; seems to reduce power by a good 50 hp, but flooring it over rides that, as does a disable button.Brakes are excellent, as is the interior with dual climate control and back up camera on the base model.

","VERY minor things - wish the motor had a more sporting sound - my 2005 MINI 4 cylinder has a great sound ... the Honda 4 cylinder does the trick, but why not tune the sound so it is appealing, not just an appliance ?Also, why just 2 color choices when getting a 6 speed manual tranny and the sedan ?Finally, why not offer the 6 cylinder with the 6 speed manual tranny with the eco mode (that almost matches the 4 cylinder on the hwy mpg) in the 4 door sedan, and at a low entry point /stripper ? My base 4 cylinder was a bargain at $20,400, but would have loved to have a 6 cylinder option for a couple grand more. Would build a lot of loyalty with the customers/be a performance bargain !

The driving experience is so good that at times it seems surreal. Quality simply oozes from every component used in the construction of this American made product.

Over 17% of this steel is of an even higher quality grade 780, 980 and 1,500 MPa, extremely high grades that have never before been used in any Accord, and in fact, very few other cars.

Great looking interior and exterior updated for 2013! Very quiet. Reliable engine. Excellent gas mileage. All new steering eliminating the need for servicing previous parts. Better breaking system. Added safety features are a comfort as well. This is the first generation of civic (2013) that I can honestly say I love everything about. Its a beautiful car especially in Crimson Pearl. Looks like a luxury car and is an excellent family car; I can fit three Diono car seats comfortably and easily into the rear seat. Kids have plenty of leg room. Spacious and fun cabin. Apparently no expenses spared for 2013! 
","In Canada we do NOT get the rear camera option on the DX and LX trim. :( My wife in particular would have preferred the rear camera. I would have too instead of the heated front seats personally (strange thing to have at all imo but then again, I normally commute on a motorcycle when not toting my family around in the Civic). There are other small differences that Canadians should look out for on Honda.ca's website as 90% of the reviews are based on American models and hence can cause confusion. This is an observation more than a con really! Otherwise, the only con I can think of is the fugly hubcaps which come on the steel wheels that are standard on the DX and LX.

There is ample head, hip and leg room affording me a very comfortable driving position. Being a DIY Homeowner having a spacious cargo area where I can carry home larger items from the local Home Improvement Store is also very important to my needs!The Crosstour has a very quiet and comfortable ride, while not a sports car by any means, it does handle very respectively. My own mpg has been quite good, 18-19 mpg in the city and just under 30 mpg on the Highway with about 1,000 miles on the odometer.In my opinion and taking into account the needs I had in a new vehicle, this is a near perfect car from Honda! Sometimes I think Honda built it specifically for me! ","I like all the cameras the 2013 Crosstour EX-L comes with. Backup camera with three views. Right side blind spot camera, Both cameras display on the center dash mounted 8"" screen. There is a 3rd camera looking out the windshield that warns you if it thinks you are getting too close to a car in front of you and also warns you if you are drifting out of your lane (without signaling). Most important option to me is the memorized seat and mirror positions for Driver's 1 and 2, that adjusts automatically when you get in the car...

It's one amazing looking car that's oh-so-fun to drive. As a lone commuter, like almost everyone else on the road, the two-seater CRZ has been perfect for me. After 6000 miles, the fuel economy remains much better than the official numbers. I get 49 mpg on NORMAL and 51 mpg on ECON. Not sure how Consumer Reports can only get 35 mpg. They must be mashing the gas and brakes in their test drives.Power in ECON and NORMAL has been adequate. When you ever need a quick burst of speed to pass, merge, beat a yellow light, or smoke an aggressive driver, punch the Sport + button and gas, and the CRZ will take off! So much fun! I don't drive SPORT mode much since the button gives me all the fun I need on most drives.The CRZ does sit very low. Since it's a coupe, the doors open out very wide. Both make getting in and out of the car kinda awkward in cramp garages and tight parking spots.

Honda truly made a vehicle in its own category: it's like a jeep, a truck and a van all in one. The Element is perfect for my active lifestyle. It is easy to park and has a small turning radius. The lack of carpet makes cleaning up spills and mud a breeze. The seats ability to fold up against the sides or be completely removed (which is slightly awkward and can be considered heavy to some people) is one of the best features because it allows you to convert the vehicle into a covered truck with an approximate 3.5ftX5ft bed great for transporting various sized objects. The tie down points are an added bonus. The suicide doors and clam shell rear hatch/tailgate are great for loading things, however, even though I don't have kids I can imagine that it might be complicated getting them in and out of their car seats -- especially infants. Braking is awesome. If you have to slam them then the car feels like it stops from the back instead of nose diving. ","The only thing this vehicle has cost me are gas (20city /28 hwy) and oil changes. Realtime 4WD. Stain resistant / Water repellent seats. Braking. Drives better with weight in the car. SPACE...unlike ALL if it's competitors. 
","Large blind spots at your 10 and 2 o'clock -- and more depending on if the seats are put up against the sides. Poor gear ratio (car likes to hover in high RPM instead of shifting). SLOW compared to other cars I have had/driven especially when climbing hills. The floor is slick when it is wet and items that are not tied down tend to slide around during transport. The plastic panels scratch easy. Seats are comfortable for short trips but don't support the lower back on long trips (probably because the steering wheel isn't telescopic).

","Everything. It's the most versatile vehicle made. Excellent access because of the suicide doors. Perfect driving position with great views. I test drove all the competitors models. The Kia and the Scion XB are meant for kids. The Nissan model Rogue & Cube are to wierd looking. Ford escape was not bad, could use and update. It was my third choice. Chevy's Equinox's door handle felt like it was going to break off when I opened the door. My second choice the Subaru Forester was a bit thin on metal I felt.

You can add a few creature comforts along the way as most do with their cars. The cost for these crossovers is also a added plus. I bought mine a few months ago certified in almost new condition. It was half the cost of my wife's Audi wagon.......SWEET! ","Going from the most functional station wagon on the market , Volvo XC70 (which I loved), to the Honda Element, I'm right at home. The Element gets the highest markets for function and practicality. That will likely not sit well with the BLING craving US market. But for buyers that can independently think and don't care to be attention grabbing while driving to work or play, this is the crossover of choice. With Honda's strong reliabilty and the Element's unmatched functionality, this car get's the job done. Loading, dogs, boxes, surfboards etc. is a pleasure. The driver and passenger positions are very comfortable and spacious. FANTASTIC CAR!!!! 
","No car is perfect. But this is subjective. I have added a sunroof upfront, leather seating, rear backup camera and cell phone holder for hands free safety. The MPG while not bad should be better. Of course, there is the conflict between fuel efficiency and functionality. The trade of here is acceptable. Most of the cons I've read are due in part with the markets push for form over function.

When I first saw it I thought that it was the ugliest car that I had ever seen, no way. Until a very knowlegeable salesperson showed me all the variable configurations of the backseat/rear area. I have a requirement that I can sleep comforatably in a vehicle and carry or pull all my toys (kayak, bike, & small tear drop camping trailer) and haul lumber too. I am a 5'-3"" female and find that most vehicles that can do the things I need; are designed to fit a guy better in the driver's seat, this driver's seat fits me comfortably. The short turning radius if fun, and the high clearance is great for my off the beaten path adventures. 
","Gas mileage could be better, and some of exterior plastic is fading. The fact the Honda is no longer making this vehicle is sad, I mourn the day that I can no longer buy another used Element because I want to drive this vehicle for the rest of my life.

Lets face it...this truck doesn't exactly win beauty contests. But, what it lacks in looks, it more than makes up for in personality and quality. I looked at ALOT of trucks from all available manufacturers. I kept coming back to the Honda (it was the 6th truck I looked at) simply because of it's overall utility. The downsides of mediocre gas mileage and a small 5ft cargo bed initially had me worried, but I can say with all the years of putting pallets of sod, slate, and tile, and stuffing it with bags of rock or piles of lumber, it does everything my old full size truck did, and never lets me down. I took points off only for appearance...it's fit and finish are top notch. The only other low score here is the performance, but I'm used to muscle cars and jeeps for that. Still, this truck is no slouch, but it's off road capabilities are limited and it's on road performance is like a sedan ","Nice roomy interior, trunk-in-bed, and really well designed utility truck. The 5ft bed may seem small initially but with the tailgate down and a strap, it has no problems moving a stack of lumber from the yard to the workplace. The back seats also flip up for extra storage as well. And for the weekend, tailgate parties are a lot of fun when you can pull up, open the truck and have a freezer with cold beverages for the game, or fill it with water for a live-well and bait storage. This under-dog truck more than surprised me over the past 5 years of ownership. Oh, and trouble-free vehicle for all 5 of those years so far. Ride quality is also extremely pleasant for a truck. 
","With gas only going higher, the compromise is that this truck is kind of in the middle of the pack. City mileage of 15 to 17 mpg and highway mileage of 19 to 22 doesn't win praise. It's look.

Your view of this car will vary depending on what type of vehicle you are coming out of. You need to take a good test drive of the Elantra before making a final decision. The materials in the car are on level with an economy car; luckily the styling overshadows some of the hard plastics. The fit and finish are on par with cars at least a class up. There is no other car that packs the value of the Elantra. Again, test drive and do some comparisons of the other guys (Civic, 3, Cruze, Corolla) and you should agree that if you are in the market for a well featured, comfortable, reliable (need i mention the 5yr/100K warranty), roomy, and stylish car then the 2013 Elantra GLS is the top pick. As a package daily driver, you cannot go wrong with the Elantra GLS w/preferred pkg. ","The Elantra's handling is well balanced and the short front overhang amplifies the nimble feeling. The power is ample for this size car, aided by how smooth the 6spd trans operates (auto). If you are stepping up from a compact - the Elantra will feel upscale. The interior space and trunk space are mid-size class. Unless you want all the premium adds (SAT, leather, etc), the best value and comfort is the GLS w/preferred package. The best trade off was not dealing with the rougher ride and road noise of the 17"" wheels on the Limited. If the supsension was a bit more high tech (independent rear vs. torsion beam axle) the Limited would be ok. The 16"" alloys are stylish and handle well. 
","If you are downsizing, you will feel some minor trade-offs (ride, power). You may have to get used to the A-pillar that is a bit wide when looking at turning traffic. The overall driving characteristics are more euro but soft enough to allow you to go for miles (though i wish the seat support was a little longer in the thigh). You will need to level your expectation on how the steering is a bit over-weighted on center or how the supsension is comfortable but you definitely feel the road bumps. Gas mileage is good but your driving habits affect it heavily (typical of smaller hp cars). Also, I have heard the Nav is somewhat hard to see in sunlight glare on the Elantra Limited.

We feel as though the mileage for any car will be the same for every person and every environment based on its window sticker at the dealership. Get yourself educated on some automotive basics. For starters, the EPA's method of obtaining mpg figures comes from a calculation, hence the reason for it being an ""estimation"". I live in a very hilly area and as far as my mileage goes, it is not what you might call brilliant, but that is life. If you are an owner of this vehicle or even others, there is usually more than one reason you bought it. If the mileage is not to your liking, enjoy and embrace the other aspects of the car. Comfort, styling, technology, spaciousness, price, these are all wonderful attributes of the Elantra as a smaller car. If every last mpg is your thing, try electric or hybrid. Weigh your desires against the car so you do not have to complain after it is purchased. ","Read my description it will shed light on a few things.

In short, I love my Elantra and intend to drive it for many years. Folks, this is not a luxury vehicle, keep this in mind when you are reviewing the car. It is a very good quality compact car. I drove all the competition in this class over several months, and in my opinion, this vehicle is by far the best in it's class : the best all-around value without doubt. I do not understand what many are stating about the poor fuel economy, as Tim pointed out, the way you drive it makes a big difference in your MPG. Jack rabbit starts and stops WILL negatively impact fuel economy. Excellerating smoothly, moving with traffic, passing as needed, planning your stops will greatly improve MPG. I drive at or no more than 5 miles over the limit, in mixed driving I always recover 31-32 mpg {winter} and 34-35 mpg {summer}. Consistant 41-42 mpg on the highway. You can too. ","Style, comfort, reliability, fit and finish, gas milage, excellent relationship with dealership sales and service.For the audiophile, the Sirius XM radio is addicting. The Elantra's sound system is excellent for a vehicle in this segment.I bought the GLS/ AT with Preferred Pkg.

Was very disappointed in the way the Honda dealerships seem so smug and do not want to deal at all on their cars. All of the other Japanese car manufacturers seemed a bit over the top in their aggressive sales approach. At the opposite end, the American dealerships seemed bored or I was bothering them. The reason I mention my dealership experiences is that in all of my homework, I could not find one car in this category that was miles above the others. All good cars for sure, so where was I going to get my best bang for the buck? The fellas at the Hyundai dealership had the correct approach...not too aggressive, not too subtle and in the end I got my car for $2500 below sticker. Well done. ","I have owned my Elantra Coupe for about six months and am very satisfied with the car, the ride, the performance, the support from the dealership and the manufacturer. From reading several other reviews here, I am not sure what has happened to some. When I run good, clean, low Ethanol gas, I average between 38-41mpg on the highway and I live in a very hilly area. Was pleasantly surprised, the first time on a two-lane highway and I stepped out to pass another car. The shifting of the automatic transmission is unnoticeable.

Performance is excellent for a small car with small engine. Dealership experience has been great so far. With 22k on the odometer, the only work done to my car aside from oil changes and inspections was a $50 allignment after hitting some nasty potholes in and around NYC. At first they thought I had a broken suspension piece, but came back and told me they just needed to adjust it. Honest and cheap to own. The interior is gorgeous for a small car. I have tan and black leather interior inside Desert Bronze outside. Color was not the desired color, but dealer gave me an amazing deal on a Limited still sitting on the lot. 
","Very few cons since I knew what I was buying. At the time, the price and styling were miles above the others. Most of the gripes I have are small with the exception of buying it as a 40MPG car. Obviously the big story here is that the car is not obtaining the 40MPG listed on the window sticker. Most people don't seem to realize that regular driving will never yield the EPA estimates, but realistically I was hoping for closer to the 35mpg mark than the 30mpg winter and 33mpg summer I've been getting. But, Hyundai is at least giving me a credit each time I service my car. Other gripes will sound silly, but front and rear dashes are textured plastics and hard to clean.

I loved my Flex and had purchased it because at the time we had a camper that we towed with it. It was a great vehicle, one of the best I have owned but not the greatest mileage.

Easily, I got around 37+ mpg during the summer and fall (mostly with AC). This winter so far, I have been averaging about 34-35. I have been told that there are additives to gasoline (that reduce mpg) during the winter to prevent freezing issues (fuel line or something like that).

","great ride, quiet, maneuverable, and stylish. I bought this car because it listed great gas milage but have been surprised to find that I was able to surpass even those great numbers. I reset the MPG gauge between city only & highway only driving & found that I got about 30MPG city and 44MPG highway with the ECO option activated. without the ECO i got about 27-39MPG. With my first 1000 miles on the ODO, i'm averaging about 34MPG overall. Not bad, and clearly better then my previous car's 18-25mpg. Steering is very responsive with no dead-zones in steering. The trunk is very large for a two door hyundai coupe. I was expecting a small trunk but found it as large as their 4 door sedan's trunk. 
","The large support bars on either end of the windshield do create a small blind-spot that's more irritating that dangerous. I was disappointed that the gas cap body covering is plastic. The cruise control is a little more cumbersome then what I had on my Mercedes, and the + or increase speed button needs several pushes to engage when you first turn on the cruise control.

The fit & finish are very impressive for a car in this price range. Since this is a new addition to the Elantra line, there's not a whole lot of info about this specific model as yet. The Elantra sedan has a lot of good reviews and a good reputation, so no worries. Lots of options for the money. Mileage is good for my mix of driving. I'm curious as to the mileage I will get on a road trip with nearly 100% highway miles. Beware of ""internet pricing"" tactics. We got a quote via e-mail for the exact specs of the car I wanted for less than we actually settled on. The reason given was because they did a dealer trade to get the car I wanted. The salesperson who replied with the internet quote priced it as if the car I wanted was actually in stock. That was the reason that the sales manager provided. I bought another vehicle (Toyota) from a different local dealer previously, with a dealer trade. There was no price deviation from them. ","I bought the 2013 Elantra Coupe SE after looking around for a coupe that was sporty, economic and had back seat leg room. Most of my driving is commuting 30+ miles per day + errands. When I have passengers, having a back seat where adults can sit without their knees tucked up to their chin is key. 30 - 32 MPG thus far, staying in ECO mode. The 6 speed A/T shifts smoothly. Cup holder easily accomodates my commuter mug. Sounds trivial? That eliminated one model that I was considering. Love the fact that I wasn't stuck with a black interior. I really do like the gray leather. I like the sunroof & spoiler. Those have become must-haves for me. Outside mirror adjustability is great. 
","It's a bit on the noisy side, but that is to be expected with the 17"" wheels. There's not a lot of rubber between the car and the road. The driver's seat could use a bit more adjustability. The seat fits me fine at 5' 6"". My husband is 5"" taller than me and he has a hard time finding a comfortable driving position. Pockets on the front seat backs would be a nice enhancement for keeping maps or cloth shopping bags within easy reach. Another nice addition would be hooks inside the trunk on each side to secure shopping bag handles. I passed on the technology package. I wasn't really seeing that the items were worth the extra $$$$.

I've adjusted to the lousy rear view, and I like the other features. When comparing brands and models, I did extensive research, and this car won without serious competition in the price range I could afford. I'm not a car fanatic; I wanted a car that it is reliable, safe, comfortable, and gives value for the cost. This car meets that criteria and gives even more. ","Have owned this car since Oct. 2012 (currently 8 months). Bought it for several reasons (warranty, mileage, etc.), but one major reason is that it fits me. I'm short, but now I don't have to hug the steering wheel to reach the pedals. Good seat adjustment, and the seat is not so huge and full of wing padding that it swallows me. Such joy! Mileage not as good as advertised, but still very good. Nice cargo space (hatchback). I like the dash arrangement, pockets, drink holders, etc. Steady on the road in 30+ mph winds. No problems at all so far. 
","Windows are currently fashionable upswept design. 1) Small children in back seat won't be able to see much. 2) The back part of the back seat windows are useless. Can't check the right rear outside view with an over-the-shoulder glance. I'm not *that* short and was able to see out easily in other cars. 3) Had to take out rear head rests (never carry passengers, no problem) because they blocked about half the rear window view. 4) The driver's visor in a down position blocks 1/3 of the rear view mirror. 5) Can't drive with windows open. Turbulence is deafening and painful. 6) To get rear view camera, must buy two expensive add-on packages; can't buy only the nav pack.

I play in a band and can carry all my gear without dropping the seats plus the full P.A. with the seats lowered if necessary.

On the way to order a Subaru BRZ Limited I stopped by the Hyundai dealer to check out the Genesis Coupe. Between not wanting to wait months for the BRZ delivery and the fact that the Hyundai dealer kept lowering his price until I received such a ridiculous deal I couldn't pass up this car. It's a great looking car, and despite my concerns about all of the hard plastic inside the interior still looks nifty. When you take off the rear wheel drive throws you back into the seat and you feel the front end get a bit light. The tuned dual tail pipes give you a nice rumble under acceleration, but at cruising speed the car is surprisingly quiet. The car has a tight turning radius, so you need to be on your toes if you accelerate hard while making a sharp turn, especially when you turn off the traction control. Overall, I like it and it's a spiffy little car. Time will tell if I trade it in for next year's BRZ. ","In the right color, this car is a real head turner. I have the 2.0T Premium in Parabolica Blue and everyone stops and stares. Effortlessly moves from zero at the stoplight to 50 mph without having to stomp on the gas.The leather/cloth combo seats are comfortable. The smaller, leather trimmed steering wheel has a nice sporty feel. Visibility out the front, back, and even the sides is very good (no blind spots). The car handles well, and for a stiff suspension the ride is comfortable. The sat/nav, stereo and bluetooth all work well. I can use bluetooth to play music from my iPhone, but it needs the cable connection to choose playlists and utilize voice command for the music. 
","In the long run I worry about the quality of the interior. There's a lot of hard plastic that can easily be scratched and gouged. Paddle shifters seem a bit flimsy. The car is a bit heavy for its size, so it's not as easy to throw it around as it is with lighter sports cars. Disappointed that the backup camera does not come standard with the 2.0T Premium package. The doors are long and not framed at the top and if you close the doors with any force they rattle like heck. The cluster gauges on the center console look good, but their location isn't practical.

If you check around the web you will see this is a very common issue. Hyundai replaced the entire fuel pump assembly under warranty and hopefully that will fix the problem. However, other owners have also had the fuel pump replaced and the problem returned. My guess is that Hyundai will need to look into this problem a bit more.It's still a fun car, but my main worry is still the long term build quality of the vehicle. ","Vehicle type: 2013 2.0T Premium. See previous review and notes below on the widely reported fuel pump problem. The car is still fun to drive, and if you're smooth on the throttle (to avoid the turbo lag) the power and the rear wheel give you a fun jolt that throws you back in the seat. The small cockpit, dark interior, and small steering wheel give the car a nice ""race car"" type of feel. On longer trips where the speed limit is 50-70 mph I have averaged over 30 MPG, but only 19 MPG around town. 
","I have the 8 speed automatic transmission that allows you to override the auto shift with the paddle shifters or the slap shift. While these are a fun little novelty, they are not practical to use if you're running an SCCA Solo II event or just trying to hot rod it around town. The problem is that the rations between first and 4th gear are so close and the response time of the manual shifting is so slow you overshoot the sweet spot in the power band for the next up shift. Performance wise, letting the computer control the shifting provides better performance.

The 8 speed auto transmission is wonderful, very smooth. The manual mode of the automatic will not hold a lower gear if you reach 'redline', it shifts automatically to save the transmission. Overall the car is excellent, the paint is very good, the styling beyond the standard. The handling, acceleration and braking is better than more expensive sport coupes. It's an exciting car to drive, and on the interstate, it's 'hard' not to drive fast. The mileage is outstanding if you can keep your 'foot out of it', 40mpg at 55mph and 31 mpg at 80 miles an hour is unbelievable. ","First ,the styling is beyond the $25K class, it's a head turner. The paint, wheels, lines and stance all spell quality, class and aggressive performance.The 2.0Turbo is very quick. The braking, ride and handling is better than my supercharged mustang with special brakes,shocks and swaybars. It effortlessly reaches 100mph, I've not taken it beyond that, 'trooper shy'. At 55mph cruising, it gets 40mpg, at 70mph on the interstate 33mpg, at 80 mph I get 29 to 31 mpg on the interstate. I just reached 20,000 miles and the mileage gets better as it is broken in. Great car!!!! The ride and cockpit comfort is excellent on long trips. 
","Heated mirrors would be nice. Went to the dealer for new intake and cabin air filters, they were not in stock. I have no real 'issues' with the car. It's a sports coupe, built for two people, small children can comfortably fit in the rear seat, but it's not meant to be more than a two passenger car. When making a fast u turn, if the skid control is not disengaged, there will be a momentary turbo lag, I thought something was wrong with the car, but the service manager told me to disengage it for the sharp turns when accelerating, the problem disappeared.

I also own the Cadillac CTS, which is a great and fun driver's car, but the Caddy's interior quality, ride comfort, and overall fit and finish do not compare to the Genesis.

Was not looking for a new car, but the new styling was too good to pass up! Not quite the same get up and go as the Rav4, but the turbo has enough oomph to push you back into your seat. The ride is extremely quiet and the vehicle feels well controlled on the freeway. Passing power is excellent. The updated navigation is a real improvement. Available Hyundai Bluelink and Sirius XM stereo are nice luxuries. The panoramic moonroof is a lot of fun. The heated seats in both front and rear will be very welcome come winter. With all the extras that Hyundai put into this vehicle, I'm surprised that they did not include a power lift gate. Maybe on a future model? Overall, very happy with this purchase. Thought I would miss the Rav4, but I don't. Have received the most questions and stares from drivers of Mercedes...go figure! Can't wait to see how the AWD handles the snow this winter.

The technology package is well worth the extra expense. Everything works exceptionally well. For those who are concerned about the lack of daytime running lights, I have found that turning on the parking lights keeps the position lights on (those eyebrow looking lights over the headlamps). Just manually turn on the headlights at dusk (I think the auto headlamps take too long to turn on, anyway). ","Have now driven almost 6K miles. Still loving all the luxuries packed into this vehicle. Power is more than ample, 12 speaker stereo pumps out 550 watts, extremely quiet - even when the moon roof is propped open. A couple of small snow showers prove that this vehicle handles slick conditions very well. Still waiting for a significant snowfall to see how it handles deeper snow. Averaging 24.4 mpg in mixed driving (this is at altitude, in extremely hilly terrain and on 85 octane gasoline) - more than 2 mpg more than I got with the Rav4-V6. Truly a pleasure to drive! 
","The acceleration curve is not linear and takes bit of getting used to. Not horrible, just an extra surge when the turbo kicks in off the starting line. As I stated in my previous review, there is hardly any turbo lag, so this happens very quickly. Once you get used to it, it's easy to adjust for it. Some minor tweaks to the programming will probably fix this. Still wish there was a power lift gate. I understand Hyndai's engineers wanting to save weight, but let's face it, Santa Fe drivers don't purchase the vehicle for its 0-60 time. We get it because it's a great, reliable vehicle, nice looking and we get a lot of bang for the buck.

There is SO MUCH you can do manually or automatically and it is all available through your driver console. Everything works, it is as advertised (yes the milage has been lowered when I bought mine) and the controls are laid out in a logical and easy to use way.

I wish it actually came in the bold Bright Metallic Orange which was shown in the Auto Shows earlier this year. Mine is the copper (dark orange).

The 12 speaker Infinity sound system and navigation are fantastic and worth every penny. The turbo has no lag, it feels like a powerful V-6. Excellent side mirrors and rear window visibility. Largest and most user friendly GPS screen on any car I've driven (bigger than Mercedes). Suprisingly quiet ride. The big tires are easy on the bumps. I get between 22-24 MPG in mostly city driving.

","I wish it had LED lights in the back (like Kia Sorrento. It should have memory seats for different drivers.

Owned my SFS2.0T FWD for over 3 months ( 1,700 miles ). Love the styling, feature set, and the quiet interior. Still no problems with the vehicle at all, so far. This follow up pertains to the EPS DSSM (steering modes). I reported earlier that the DSSM Sport Mode was a bit over boosted and the vehicle required allot of steering input during high speed freeway driving (=>65 mph). A service tech stated that tire pressure or a sensor software tweak may be the culprit. It seems that the factory & some dealers are over inflating the tires (19 inch Continentals) by as much as 10 psi. I checked the tire pressure (cold), and they were at about 48 psi! I deflated each tire to exactly 38 psi (the service tech recommended 36), and it drove like a different vehicle. Sport mode tracking felt more precise and properly weighted. Now I primarily use Sport mode ( just like the reviewers at Car and Driver)! ","Quiet, Modern, well designed interior. Lots of interior room. Very smooth ride, even at high speeds! Seamless and smooth six speed shiftable transmission. Great exterior design. Lots of great features. Excellent Infinity audio. Bluetooth & voice recognition works well. Most features such as vehicle greeting (chime), lighting, locks, and traction control, can be custom configured or disabled. Blue link remote services also work as advertised. Solid handling. Gas mileage is about 23.5 mpg combined, even better in Econ mode. I may use econ mode for some city driving.

Purchased the 2.0T FWD w/ Tech package, Blk with Beige Leather interior. I needed a vehicle for trips to visit my daughter and my father (both over 3 hours away), as well as a decent utility vehicle (for Lowe’s). I average about 24 mpg combined so far. The steering has received a lot of attention and here is the deal. DSSM is just fine in Normal mode. The nominal on-center tracking effort and build up is good (with the ECO mode off!). Traction control is enabled by default in each mode as well, but it can be turned off for each. Sport mode needs to be dialed in and recalibrated. It tends to feel slightly over boosted during on-center tracking over 65 mph. It is tight and immediate, but the electric torque sensors and steering feel need tweaking. Comfort mode is just for parking! . Still, the wife and I love it, and save for the Sport mode; this Santa Fe can easily be a standard bearer, if they would just tweak the DSSM! ","The Santa Fe is very smooth, very quiet on the highway. It has a luxuriously solid, well insulated feel to it. It has a plenty of cargo and rear seat room. Good power delivery when needed. Easily the sexiest SUV in its class. It was also awarded ‘Wards 10 best interiors’ for 2013. Road and wind noises are very much kept to a whisper and it is very comfortable on long trips.

All for $21,500. 
","The shape of the front seats: the raised sides make for a painfull long term seating for a wider person. I had to add extra padding on the middle part of the seat to raise.

We decided to purchase a new vehicle about a year ago, so I spent a lot of time researching vehicles. We narrowed the choice down to several cars, specifically the Sonata, Altima, Camry, Optima, and Accord. All of them had advantages, but the Sonata had the best selection of standard features and was available at the best price. My wife has driven a 2003 Hyundai Accent for the past 8 years, and it has given us excellent service. It now has approximately 200,000 mile on it, and it has never given us any problems. It is a 5 speed manual and still has the original clutch. After experiencing this kind of service from a Hyundai product, we decided to take a closer look at the Sonata. We look forward to years of good service from our GLS. We purchased our vehicle at First Team Hyundai in Roanoke, Virginia. Keith Morris and Chip Bennett were great to work with. They were very professional and took care of us! A great place to buy a vehicle! ","We purchased a GLS with the Popular Equipment Package several days ago. There are many features that we found appealing. The fit and finish on our car is excellent. The seats are very comfortable, and the material is stain resistant. There is plenty of room for five people to sit comfortably in the car. The electronic features are a plus. The 2.4L motor has plenty of power and the 6 speed automatic transmission shifts very smoothly. The ride is smooth and road noise is not an issue. The steering is responsive and the car handles well. The trunks is large and the fold down rear seats are convenient for carrying large cargo. This is a quality vehicle. We like the 10 year/100,000 mile warranty. 
","I have no issues with our Sonata. We are very pleased with our choice.

I love so many features of this car and don't regret it at all. Great offering out of Hyundai and perfect car for my needs. ","Car offers just about everything I could want from a vehicle. It has an Eco mode which aides in the gas mileage when I don't need the get up and go. But when I want the get up and go, I turn the eco mode off and punch it. Interior is modern and stylish. The technology is great. There is plenty of room for my family and the car is fun and stylish. This car can get up and go and hold on to the rode tightly. It offers great leg room for passenger both front and back. It has tons of space in the trunk. Overall if you want a sedan for sport and family, Hyundai's got you covered 
","2 very minor things- the bluetooth volume must be maxed every time I use it. I have my phone volume up and then I must turn the car volume up to get a decent output. This is an inconvience and by no means a deal breaker. The other issue is the lighting for the shifter- its insanely bright in the dark. I like my lighting very subdued and this is just too bright.

","We just bought the 2013 Hyundai Sonata GLS with the 4 cylinder engine and auto trans. We love this car! It is very stylish looking with a great looking drivers console. Very good gas mileage and so far zero problems with the car but it's brand new so we will see how well she holds up in the coming years. Good acceleration for a 4 cylinder but at 200 hp has plenty of zip. Warranty can't be beat and overall just the best car value for the price ($20,245). Rear seat has plenty of leg room and a very large trunk that allows you to lower the rear seat for added cargo area. The deal sealer was they has 1 color combination on the lot I really wanted, Pacific Blue Pearl with grey interior. Sold! 
","Not much to complain about, I have read the reviews that the passenger seat sits low but not really a major issue for us. There is a little road noise but that could be diminished significantly with a different set of tires. Most new cars come equipped with a standard variety type of tire so when these get worn out we will upgrade to a very good rated steel belted radial tire that should help reduce road noise.

","I don't like much about it. It is not good on mileage in spite of how it was advertised. The size is good for my purpose but I was taken advantage of during the purchase from a Vancouver, WA dealer 
","The tires on the new 2009 Tucson I purchased had to be replaced at 26,000 miles. According to Hyundai the tire manufacturer provides the warranty. When I checked with Bridgestone they advised that these particular tires did not have a warranty on them. Of course Hyundai must be aware of that fact and put the cheapest tires available. Bridgestone did give me a little back on new tires but I am still out of pocket over $600.00. I will not buy another Hyundai.

It looks fantastic, I get compliments on it all the time. In terms of styling and value for the money I would strongly claim it is the best in its class. For a 4-cylinder engine without a turbo, it is surprisingly fast. The seats are extremely comfortable as well. So far I haven't had any problems with reliability. I have driven my front wheel drive car in 6-inches of snow and thanks to the traction control and stability control I felt very confident driving it and it handled wonderfully. 
","I love the car but at the end of the day it is an economy car. Some of the interior components feel cheap and I am concerned about some of the interior falling apart relatively early in the game. The ride is also a bit stiff you you will feel every bump on the road. Initially I didn't get the advertised fuel economy but with time I have noticed improvement on the fuel economy.

I actually purchase the veloster turbo from a dealer 135 miles from where I live (local dealers just stocked automatic in black or silver). Glad I waited for the turbo w/manual transmission. Extremely happy with the marathon blue color & get many many compliments about the styling & color. I test drove both the base model & turbo. I recommend getting the turbo version because of the power issue of pulling into traffic. I think everyone will enjoy the feel the turbo gives the veloster. I have owned the veloster 2 months and have yet to find any problems. I haven't even had it into the dealer for adjustments. The quality of the workmanship is outstanding. The car is well built & when you close the doors, you hear a solid thud. Like many of the other reviews have said, the appearance is unique, eye catching and bold. Just love driving it everywhere. Kind of feel sorry for my Toyota Celica that just sits in the driveway most of the time. ","Great assortment of standard options. Large screen for the navigation system/radio, which is a big advantage when driving & concentrating on the road. Placement of the USB ports & other outlets is perfect, easy to reach. Sun roof is perfect in size & operates flawlessly. Seats are very comfortable (I drive 75 miles a day) with plenty of leg room in the front, rear is a little tight (but that is expected with this style of car). The instrument panel is very easy to read, well organized. Styling is unique, eye catching and stands out from the ordinary. Great handling & power when you need it (turbo version). Everything about the veloster makes it fun to drive. Problem free so far.. 
","I really do not dislike anything about my Veloster. The only real disappointment is that I have been averaging about 31mpg (90% of my driving is highway). I did find in the last week that reducing my speed from the posted 70mph to 65mph, the fuel economy has jumped to 35/36mpg. I believe that engine in the veloster is set up for the 55mph to 65mph range. The only complaint is getting the add-on options after purchase. My turbo did not come with the mud guards and so far (2 months), they are not available from Hyundai.

","Almost all the bells and whistles. Hyundai decided to go with a flat repair kit rather than giving the driver an actual spare tire and a jack, All well and good, unless you damage the sidewall, Hyundai, I almost give you a perfect score. Redeem yourself by providing an optional spare tire and jack for purchase. Or better yet, add it into the basic package. I still love the car but on long trips through the desert, I lack peace of mind as a result of this cost control measure.

It is fun to drive, easy to maintainand the warranty is excellent. It has better safety features than many other small cars and I actually feel safer in this car than some that are much larger or more expensive. Other than my turbo diesel, 1 ton truck, this is my first brand new, ordered from the factory car that I have ever purchased. I purchased my 2013 Veloster in 2012, tracked it from the boat leaving Korea to a train, then a semi, then to my dealership! I thought it was great to be able to do that, thru the dealership, I recommend it to anyone! ","I love my new car!!! I have put 2,000. miles on it and have never had 1 single problem.

I have to say that Hyundai has a great warranty. I was also impressed to find out that they are going to reimburse me about $25 for every 3000 miles because their estimated miles per gallon was off by a few gallons - the car still gets awesome gas mileage. I highly recommend this car. ","I was initially looking at the Hyundai Elentra because I wanted a compact car. After driving the Elantra, I decided it wasn't sporty enough. My husband recommended I try the Veloster and before I even test drove it, I fell in love. As soon as I sat in the car, I said this is my new car! The car has a very sporty feel, has lots of tech options, and handles well on the road. I have the dual clutch option and it feels like I am driving a manual shift car at all times, even when I am not taking advantage of the dual clutch. I have a sunroof and leather/cloth combo seats and love both features. I would highly recommned this to someone looking for a fuel economy car. 
","The only con I have to the Veloster is the lack of ""umph"" when trying to accelerate. However, this problem can be solved when using the dual clutch. Initial take off is good, the lag comes between 2nd and 3rd gear.

It rides like a sports car and turns on a dime, very fun to drive on twisty roads! Although it lacks the power that my 91 Camaro had, it gets up pretty well for a 1600cc, (manual transmission).

The car handles great, but sadly, the 1.6L GDi still has that lag between 1st & 2nd gear (it's in the computer). The 7"" touch screen is cool, and Bluetooth connectivity to your smartphone lets you make calls through controls on the steering wheel, although it's flakey (I've had to reset it and download my contact several times). My main complaint is the poor visibility to the rear quarter panels, solved somewhat by adding a spot mirror to eact outside rearview mirror. The shoulder strap cuttinginto my neck is bothersome, as well (working on a solution to that). The Veloster sits low and has a wide stance, and is a hoot to drive on twisty mountain roads. On the interstate, I averaged about 38mpg @ 70mph; the drive was smooth and relatively quiet. If Hyundai would reprogram the computer, this could really be a driver's car. ","Looks awesome, low, squat stance gives it great handling; Bluetooth connectivity allows you to make hands-free calls from your smartphone; 37-38mpg on the highway; seats feel great with nice legroom 
","The 1.6L GDi still has the 1st-2nd gear lag; Bluetooth not very reliable (have to keep resetting my phone); rear quarter panel visibility is poor; driver's side shoulder strap rides on your neck; speedo and mpg guages aren't accurate

I'm sure it will go down in my history books as one of my favorite cars. I plan to keep it long enough to pass on to my kids. (I'm currently child-less so I'll be holding on to it for a LONG time!) ","I really love the styling. It's so cute and it's a definite head turner. I get lots of compliments and questions. I love having a car that no ones really seen before. This car has so many features, many of them standard, that I couldn't pass it up. I was looking at a Honda Accord Coupe but after loading it up with all the features I wanted, I was going to have to pay way more than I wanted. I was able to get the Veloster fully loaded and stay well within my price range. I knew I wanted a coupe but the 3rd door is such a cool feature. I love that my friends can get in the back without me having to adjust my front seats. Lots of room inside. I can even fit my bike inside comfortably. 
","Just like the other reviewers, I wish it had a little more power under the hood. That's really my only complaint.

This car has a more powerful engine, more interior room and seats, and a better warranty. Resale value probably isn't so great due to lack of demand.

I had considered buying the Lexus RX350 but the Veracruz offered far more features and a better warranty for much less. I especially like the (very comfortable) third row of fold down seats, which allows me to carry seven passengers. The remote power liftgate in back is fantastic. Seats are comfortable and there is plenty of legroom and headroom. Power sunroof is nice. Integrated garage door opener in rearview mirror is great. Heated side-view mirrors, auto temperature controls, ergonomic everything. Plenty of interior lights and cupholders. Enough airbags to make you feel very safe. 
","Lowsy gas mileage averaging 18 mpg in combined city/highway driving, which leads to a short driving range of around 320 miles per tank of fuel. After 60,000 miles I can report that the car has had some reliability issues including having several suspension components replaced (under warranty). A software upgrade affected driveability at 35-40 mph making the car's transmission upshift too early leading to a loss in torque and some shaking in steady speed driving. It took 3 visits to the dealer but now the problem appears fixed. I lost one of my two electronic key fobs and had to pay $250 for another! Made me miss the days of the 99 cent car key.

It has all the sportiness that makes driving fun and the luxury that makes driving pleasant. All controls are well laid out and easy to use. The display screen is large and easily viewed while driving and when the car is parked can be used to watch movies via the integrated DVD player. While driving on the highway the navigation screen displays the legal speed limit, which is great when traveling through different states. Finally there is the sound of the exhaust, EXCELLENT! 
","The seatbelt assist lever could use some improvement, however it serves the purpose of making the belt easier to reach.

The g37x is a BMW killer for much less money. The car feels like a sports car when you want to have fun and is smooth and quiet when you are just trying to get home. Nothing else in the smaller luxury cars comes close to the g37 in price, standard equipment, or performance characteristics. Feels like the car is much more expensive then it is. As a techie the media system is a bit disappointing functionality wise, not very Android friendly, and sometimes has a problem using music sources from iPod rather then music (specifically Spotify).Overall the car is incredible, take one for a test drive and you will understand. In the price range you cant do better then the speed and equipment of this sedan. I have never driven this car without a huge smile on my face. ","Acceleration is brutal. Engine note is fantastic. Handling is great even in the snow (AWD). Interior is nicely appointed, and mostly everything is standard. The styling is incredible, the car is truly stunning to look at. Bose sound system is very clear and very loud. Car guide in the backup cam is surprisingly very useful. Heater goes up to 90 and mimics tropical conditions. 
","If you have a heavy foot don't expect to pass by many gas stations. The steering wheel is wearing a bit quickly. Bose system could have more bass (but that's not their thing anyway). Only USB connection on 2013 model, AUX would be nice (some had this). If you brake sharply in sport mode then accelerate briefly the engine sometimes hangs around 3100 RPM no matter accelerator position, can be very shocking when it happens the first time (could just be mine also).

","Speaking as an avid car enthusiast, the car is a great car all around. There is one short coming that comes to mind. It is not with the car itself, but with its image. The car is not recognized as an equal to its German rivals. It doesn't get the respect and recognition it deserves.

","I have owned my 2013 model for almost 2 months now. It is a thoroughly enjoyable vehicle to drive. I primarily bought it for 4 hr drives to and from a second home. The middle row leg-room is terrific as I have 2 rather tall teenagers who love riding in this car/truck. I thought about buying any number of full size or luxury SUV's and so far I am really happy with this one. Specifically, besides the overall leg-room and head-room, I love how quietly and smoothly the vehicle rides. The controls are easy to work and well marked, and I love the wood in the interior design. I hope that I can own this vehicle for a long time.

I love this vehicle - other than the headrest on the front seats. It's uncomfortable if you lean back to take a nap as a passenger. The seats were initially a little hard during a long trip but we've had it for a couple of months now and they are breaking in. We had a Tahoe last and test drove the Lexus, Escalade, and Nissan for comparison. This beat them all, hands down.

It was simpler and I don't think that any of the interior changes were for the better. The old camera system made more sense to me, storage was a huge factor, leg room for a large luxury suv was important to me, everything is now unnecessarily chunky and squished together. I can't even fit my old garage door opener on the sunvisor because the clip is too small. For the first time in 7 years I am starting to look at other model cars for when this lease is up. ","This will be my third Qx56, this year being a new model. What I like most about this car is how smoothly and luxuriously it drives. This new model allows the ability to hook up your iPhone, or other device for listening to music which was not possible in the previous model (very frustrating). The camera system is very nice and helps with parking this very large vehicle. I like the style of the front exterior and the new voice activated nav system is wonderful so that you can still use it when you are driving unlike before. 
","#1 complaint is the elimination of all real storage and cargo space. The indispensable pocket between the two front seats has been eliminated and replaced by a GIANT unnecessary dial for gear change. Why? For something rarely used, keep it on the dash where it was. Ceiling compartment for storage - gone. Rear compartment where the jack is - half the sz as before - lg umbrellas no longer fit. Door pockets - shallow and useless. Covered console between front seats - shallow and topped off with an 6 inch thick door . Comfortable arm rests - eliminated. 3rd row leg room - cramped. Technology - sometimes so complicated it's more of a pain than it's worth. No more room or I would go on...

I can't wait to burn them off and put some real tires on this car. They changed some of the traditional features such as the in dash clock is gone, the instrument cluster no longer moves with the tilt steering wheel, the drive mode is now at your finger tips instead of banging the shift lever to the left to go to ""Sport"" , the navigation has many improvements and it goes on and on. I am truly infatuated with this car after 1250 miles. This sports sedan has the best of all worlds all the while having the most reliable power train going (look up Wards).

The park assist automatically terminates once you reach 10 mph, but if it's a real hassle to you, above the drivers seat there is a buttong with the letter ""P"" that lights up when park assist is on. If you push that button, park assist will disengage and the touchscreen will return to normal. I've also heard some writers complain ""Why should I have to use the touchscreen to heat or cool my seats?"" You don't! There is a button just beneath the touchscreen that has a picture of two seats facing each other. You can use that button in cases when the navigation or something else is onscreen..:) I know the owners manual is a big read. But it's there for a reason.

Interior is spacious with very comfortable seats. Having the off road capability is a huge plus. Love having 5 different driving modes including, auto, sand/mud, sport, snow, and rock.

","Transmission felt a little too indecisive/""shifty"" during first few days of use but I note that this is completely absent now; perhaps it adapts to driving style over time as it is pleasantly smooth now; my biggest gripe is not unique to Jeep but is the tendency of auto makers to ""bundle"" options often including those I do not need/want in a package I must choose to get something I do want;

We have only had our Trailhawk for 2 weeks now but have been in thick sand, off roading on trails, and in snow. It handled them all amazingly. It is better looking in person. Photographs don't do it justice. We have gotten lots of compliments from friends and strangers who have seen it. ","Turning radius is amazing. Can do a U Turn at any intersection. I like that it's a family car to drive to work and drop the kids off at school but on the weekends, it has the capability to go in the snow and on trails. Technology is really nice. Can fit 3 people comfortably in the back seat. Cargo space is plenty for the size of the car. Back seat is split and can slide forward or back. Seats lie totally flat to put extra items in. Storage under the passenger seat. I traded in a 10 year old Altima and the gas mileage is the same so far so no complaints there. 
","A small annoyance but on the back of the front seats, there is only one pocket (on the driver seat). I would like one on the back of the passenger seat for storage on road trips since I have 2 kids.

He really catered to my needs. When I finally do decide to buy I will fly down to LA just to buy from him. Other car salesman should really take notice. ","But this one was the exception. I was on a business trip in Louisiana and went to Lake Charles. While perusing through town I saw the Chrysler dealership and saw they had the Cherokee's. Now I told the dealer that I was out of town and there just for business with no intent to buy no time soon. I swear I had the best experience from that car dealer.The vehicle was astounding, the guys at jeep really put their heart and soul into this vehicle. I just couldn't believe it.

","Chorokee is the quietest with both base 4 cyl. and the V6 of the 3 vehicles in contention for my purchase (other 2 are Ford Escape and Mazda CX5). Was the most comfortable with Escape second. Cherokee's navigation system was most visible and accessible. Really like hidden storage space under passenger front seat and space under floor cargo cover plus moveable rear seats on tracks. Really liked ""Cold Weather"" option group. Like the fact that ""red"" color was not at additional cost. Three year residual value is great! 100,000 mile powertrain warranty is clearly better than the 60,000 miles on the Escape and the CX5. Cherokee's fit and finish is outstanding! 
","I am really disappointed at the lack of cargo volume in the Cherokee being 54.9 cubic feet, versus Escape at 68.1 and CX5 at 65.4 cubic feet respectively. I am coming from a Subaru Forester at 68.6 cubic feet max cargo volume. I measured cargo volume with rear seats down for length, width and height versus the Forester and found that the serious negative on the Cherokee is the width between the rear wheel-wells. This is a design oversight and the Jeep product planners should have caught this, because they do complete tear-downs of competing cars.

Not only does this vehicle have some amazing technology inside of it, but the functionality and ease of use of it all was very impressive. I do want to note that MSN has made an error in the towing capacity for Models with the 3.2L Pentastar. It is rated for 4,500lbs, not 2,000lbs. I have been a Jeep owner my whole life and can truely say that with the addition of the 2014 Jeep Cherokee, Chrysler group is going to make the midsize SUV market rethink how to make a great vehicle. 
","The exterior design was something that had to grow on me. I was not used to seeing a body line that runs through the middle of the grill.

The Trailhawk will be overkill for most people. For suburbanites like me, the Limited will be just right. The Mazda CX-5 is nice, so is the Ford Escape. The 2014 Cherokee Limited 4x4 loaded with the V6, is the real deal. Once the rebates come out, I'll be all over it. ","This thing is loaded to the max with technology, which I love. The instrument cluster is sweet, all cars should look like this. This is the only compact SUV you can get with a V6 and real 4WD capability. After driving it, I'm sold on the power and driving capability. Watch the YouTube videos of the Trailhawk's off-road capabilities. 
","It's priced a little too high. With $2000-3000 in rebates, it will be just about right. The rear leg room is ok, but not great. As a 6' guy, I can get my driving position set, then sit in the backseat without my legs touching the seat in front, but just barely. A long trip with four large adults, might get uncomfortable. This is probably consistent across all compact SUVs. The past quality of Chrysler products worries me. Their designs are fantastic now, I just hope the quality has improved too. I'll probably end up leasing one when I'm ready. I noticed one Trailhawk at my dealership had an exposed wire in the wheel well, where it should have been covered with a protective sheath.

Thanks to Jeep's cash incentives and dealership discounts, the price of this new vehicle was a bargain. The ride and handling of the liberty are fantastic for a truck-based SUV... and I can't understand why it receives such a bad rap in this department. I traded in my 2006 Ford Fusion SEL V6 for this thing and have no regrets. This truck is packed with technology and provides excellent quality and refinement for a rugged, trail-rated Jeep! Oh yes, and this truck can also tow 5,000 LBS... I would love to see a cute ute, crossover, minivan, etc. accomplish all of the above tasks and still yield great driving dynamics on pavement! ","The excellent four-wheel drive system, coupled with Jeep's traction and electronic stability control, make the vehicle unstoppable on trails and on snow/ice-laden roads. The Infinity sound system is fantastic! In addition, the ride and handling of this vehicle are impressive for its size and chassis. 
","The antique PowerTech V6 and four speed automatic transmission are nothing to write-home about, as they have been used in the liberty for roughly a decade. Fuel economy is rather poor in the city, but I knew this would be the case prior to purchasing the vehicle.

The Jeep provides a very secure feeling on or off road. It is very maneuverable and has a tight turning radius. On the test drive, the salesman told us to hit potholes and drive over curbs. The owners manual advises high RPM runs during break-in. The V-6 engine has a cast iron block and is one of the stronger engines Chrysler makes. We are very impressed by the usefulness of the Jeep Liberty. This little truck is not for everyone, but if you need to off-road, it is great.

It's nice to know when unpredictable weather hits, I have the vehicle that's ready. The 4WD in Jeep's are in a category by themselves. No other vehicle can do it better. I thought it was funny that Consumer Reports doesn't rate these vehicles really high but they continue to sell like hotcakes. Had to wait a week to get mine. ","Have the 2DR model. Went with the hardtop, have the nav sys., Sirius radio. Instead of manual, went with the auto and glad I did. You can pop out of Drive and manually select gears 1-5. It is really a good way to go. Can't get over how quiet it is. The sound system (Alpine) sounds just awesome. I love the Pentastar 6 cyl. Believe me it has the guts to get up and go and that was a big concern of mine. I had a 1995 Wrangler and for long trips, it was a real drag. This Wrangler is very comfortable and easily would do a long trip without any issues. It drives really nice.

I've had it almost one year - almost 13000 miles on it now. It has an incredible amount of storage space. I do craft shows on weekends, and other vendors are amazed at how how stuff I can pack into it - tents, weights, tables, displays, product, luggage, etc. I get around 40MPG - sometimes even a little more! Almost all highway driving, using cruise control. My husband doesn't use the cruise & only gets around 34 or 35 MPG. The front wheel drive was great for getting traction on the northern Wisconsin roads last winter. When I'm not hauling all my stuff around, 4 people fit comfortably - 5 if they're skinny. plenty of leg room both front & back. Great car! 
","rear visibility isn't great - the dividing wall between the rear window & the back seat windows makes a blind spot that's especially troublesome when trying to back out of a diagonal parking space. Although it does well on slippery roads, it sits so low that it has trouble going through even moderately deep snow. No other complaints.

We prices a loaded Prius (leather, nav, moonroof, etc.) and it was about $1500 less. In our minds, it was worth it for the service and quality that Lexus brings. If you don't want an option-loaded car, the Prius or the Civic Hybrid is a better call. Both are quiet and smooth and you'll be happy with the savings. The Lexus has a very sleek look (from the front, it gets mistaken for an IS250), and is a sharp car. No Lamborghini, but we have gotten several compliments from friends and valets. The gas savings are fantastic for us. ","I've lost count of how many Lexuses (Lexii?) we've owned. We bought two of these, and I think they are #6 and #7. After a brief switch to BMW (trying something new), we are back with Lexus.This car is a very smooth ride. Very very quiet. There is a commercial about a hybrid owner that forgets which side of the car the gas tank is on - it's absolutely true. I fill up twice a month and it cost $25 each time. The backseat is plenty roomy for children or adults. Lots of cargo room when you need it. We use it mostly for highway driving, and still get around 40MPG without even trying. 
","If you are a large adult (6'2"" or over), you won't like the front seat. Your head will hit the moonroof. In ""eco mode"", the acceleration is a bit sluggish, but what do you expect? It does great in ""sport mode"", but you lose about 5 MPG there. One of our cars has the leather and the other does not. I highly recommend the leather package. It gives it that true Lexus feel.

But the rear visibility is perfectly awful. I have removed the rear-seat head restraints, which helps a little but not enough. I am very puzzled as to why others haven't remarked negatively on this. I see it as a major design flaw-- a genuine safety hazard. I have (reluctantly) decided to trade it in for what will probably be a less economical hybrid, but a vastly safer one.

I love the hands-free blue connectivity to my Iphone, the ample storage area, and the fantastic gas mileage. As far as maintenance, it is just like a standard all-gas car even though it is a hybrid. I was considering the Toyota Venza to get similar luxury and extras, but the Venza was more expensive and the mileage would have been much less. I'm getting the advertised 43 miles per gallon! I can't say enough about this car! I don't understand why people shy away from hybrids. This car is fabulous! 
","My only complaints are minor issues. To get the built in navigation system I would have had to pay $3,500 more! It would have been nice for aesthetics to have the built-in, but it's too pricey when I already own a Tomtom. The $3,500 also included leather upholstery but the faux leather I got instead is beautiful and most people can't tell the difference. I get compliments on the interior from the car wash guys. One other minor quibble is there is no electronic link to my garage door opener as on all other Lexus models. I have to clip my opener on the visor which spoils the neat look of the interior, in a small way.

I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone. ","The ride is what you expect from a Lexus: smooth and quiet. It is also aesthetically pleasing to look at as it actually looks like a normal sedan, unlike most hybrids. This was important to me because most true hybrids (Prius, HS 250h, etc.) aren't very appealing aesthetically. Obviously gas mileage was my biggest selling point. Right now I'm averaging around 43 MPG and it is awesome. It takes a couple of weeks to get the braking and coasting techniques down, but your wallet will thank you once you do. 
","Although the vehicle has 200 hp, the acceleration isn't the best. Then again, if you want to save gas, you shouldn't accelerate too much anyways. The EV Mode is pretty useless. Most times the vehicle won't let you go into EV Mode for whatever reason and it turns itself on and off automatically anyways.

The ride is quiet and comfortable; my gas mileage seems to be better than quoted; and it takes Regular Unleaded vs. Premium required in most luxury cars. I only have 1200 miles on it, so I can't address mechanical issues or reliability yet. I would rate this car a 10+ if I had kept my emotions in check at the dealership and held my ground for one with black interior. ","I love the NAV system and Lexus EnForm. Looked at a 2013 BMW and Infinitie - the tech package in the ES is far superior to the others, especially to the BMW 3 series. Quiet ride; doesn't look like my ""grandfathers luxury sedan"" - with the spoiler it looks sportier. 
","I went into the dealership knowing that I wanted my car in Pearl White with black interior. Unfortunately, I got caught up in the excitement and beauty of the only white ES 350 they had; it has parchment interior. I told the salesman several times that I wanted black interior, and he said there were none around, and it could take 5 months to order one with black interior. In retrospect, I wish I had held out for the black interior. I called the dealer two days after my purchase, but they seemed unwilling, or perhaps unable, to help me get into one with black interior. Bottom line - I do not like the parchment interior.

The Clown that gave this car two low reviews should be removed from the review listing. I do realize that everyone is entitled to an opinion, but his postings lowers the rating on this automobile and I think that these are malicious reviews. It deserves 9.9 period. The European cars have nothing over this vehicle. There are actually 3 bias reviews on the GS350. This Lexus GS350 has replaced a Volvo, which previously replaced a BMW.

When you only spend 5% of your time driving in anger, you want the other 95% to be served by quiet, comfortable compliance. However you drive, the fierce front end of the F-Sport effectively combines class with intimidation. Power is smooth and civilized. Sport + throttle and suspension settings make this car corner like a house fly while never leaving any doubt in your mind. The traction control protects you but still allows for some drama. There's nothing like a smooth, comfortable car that is quielty straining at the leash, just waiting to deliver some over-steer on that quiet back road hair pin. Sitting still, it has a look of urgent desire that calls to you like a recalcitrant child who wants to skip school today and play instead. Of any style feature on the car, the 19"" rims command more attention than any other, often being mistaken for custom. 40 somethings, it's time to make some dreams come true and this is the place to start. ","Be sure to test drive, this is unlike any Lexus you've seen before. Class and luxury until you your foot goes into the Axminster. Deep intake and exhaust noise make the F-Sport come to life. For the best fun, use the dual-clutch paddle shifters and take that 306bhp V-6 to 7,000 rpms to experience the symphony of destruction. While noise and speed come quickly, the torque department leaves a lot to be desired. Going fast is most fun when it ""feels"" fast and this is where Lexus opts to pursue civility and smooth power over a whack in the back of the head torque snap. It depends on your personal tastes. 
","Let's get this straight, this a businessman's car that wakes up when you tell it to and brings some real fun into your daily grind. The F-Sport is far too big and heavy to ever be confused for sports car. But it is the best of both worlds. A fun and exciting car for those rare opportunities when you find yourself on that desolate stretch of Interstate or country road. A quiet, compliant, wonderful place to be when you need your car to soothe your fevered brow after a hard days work. A significant lack of torque may feel a little dull and point out the serious bulk this car is hauling around.

Mercedes was most luxurious and pretty reliable, Jaguar was most fun to drive although it stayed in the shop, BMW was the ultimate driving machine, and my RX was most reliable with a smooth ride for a SUV. HOWEVER, this GS has it ALL!!! It is comfortable, handles excellent, love the interior styling, and it looks and drives mean (in Sport mode). Lexus is one smooth ride! Although I haven't had it that long, going by my RX (*which I have had for 4 years) I expect few if any issues. Lexus' reputation for reliability speaks for itself.

The rear of the car is pretty good, but not as stylish as the front. We added a spoiler which helped. The new sleek line that goes from the tail lights to the bottom of the doors is awesome looking. The interior is sporty looking in the F sport. I love the new Nav/Sterero unit. So much nicer than the old system. We felt the 250 had enough power for us and it saves on gas mileage. We are not Hot Rodders, but just like to have the power for passing and getting out of the way when needed. This engine is quite adequate. If you like to show off or just want more power, get the IS350. 
","The FS does not offer the park assist, memory seats, air cooled or air cooled seats. These are some of the creature comforts that we like, but it wasn't a deal breaker. It did come with cross traffic sensors and sensors that light up when another car is beside you. Great for changing lanes.

The Audi A7 was wonderful too although the rear seat was tight and the interface, for me, was more difficult, although loved the wifi. The Audi A8 was excellent as well, although to get a V8, the dealer only had long wheelbase, which I didn't want and even if I waited to get one, it was about $20K more. Thinking about how I drive, in the city or highways with tons of slow people, the serenity, quietness, fast acceleration and reliability of the LS made it the right choice. I don't find the interface difficult, as some reviewers have commented. And I have to say I am confused about the performance comments. This car is fast, you hit 90 on the highway and don't even realize it, it is so quiet and stable. Perhaps because I don't drive on mountain roads, I don't understand the performance issue, but driving down the highway, it seems to perform better than the BMW or Audi because it is so easy to drive and so quiet. ","I had the pleasure to buy a new car this year. Audi A7 and A8 were my first choice for a test drive after driving the BMW 740 last year and being disappointed with the car, as seemed austere, difficult interface and mediocre reliability. MB and Jag not on list due to mediocre reliability and MB's high price. Test drove an S6 and A7 and almost bought the A7 until my husband suggested the LS 460. Thinking, like many others the car is too stodgy, I decided to head to the Lexus dealer anyway because of the top rated reliability. I fell in love with the redesigned LS. It is incredibly quiet, an unbelievable driving experience, very fast, handles extremely well on highway. Hard to stay under 80. 
","Has some blind spots but the blind spot monitoring mitigates this. Has to be one of the best features ever if you drive in heavy traffic. It does not have wifi, which would be good for passengers. Need to have an option like the Audi S or AMG, instead of not adding more horsepower to the F-sport. If Lexus had upped the horse and tongue on the F-sport, would have wanted that car.

It is a delight to drive and own. I love driving this SUV and I enjoy knowing that a purchase of this magnitude is for a vehicle that is well built and likely to last. ","The build quality on this vehicle is amazing. I owned a mercedes GL before the LX and the quality difference is night and day. It came flawless from the factory and has absolutely no issues. It is a very quiet and relaxing vehicle to drive. The LX is very capable off road, I have had it up to the doors in mud. The audio and tech systems are a step up from mercedes as well. There is plenty of power and acceleration, even though my daily commute is through high mountain passes in Colorado. There are compromises having a box on frame construction, but overall i love this thing. I hope they keep making them. I would buy another, but I wont be able to wear this one out anytime soon. 
","The trade off for box on frame construction is a more truck like ride. It does not corner at freeway speed quite as well as the mercedes GL. The rear cargo area is smaller than the competition and I average 17mpg. A diesel or turbo option may help fuel economy. Despite these concerns, I still highly recommend this SUV. I can not stand spending $70,000 on a mercedes that turned itself into unreliable, expensive to repair junk in 70,000 miles. The mercedes dealer was always pleasant to work with, but I was tired of being on a first name basis with the service manager.

Toyota corporation has spent billions building up the Lexus brand in the past 20 years and it's time to reap those rewards. The car is a couple of steps above your Toyota/Honda/Nissan and slightly ahead of the Infinit and Acura. The price you pay is definately higher than any of its competition. I would say around 15% more for comparable non-Lexus vehicle. The service department comes with an excellent reputation and Lexus really stands behind their cars. So it's a trade off between paying the high price now for good service and reliability or saving a few bucks now but knowing that you will encounter repair bills later. I've always taken chances with a cheaper car. Once I did own a Mercedes Benz 190E, but I had just as many repairs as a Nissan. So with my first Lexus, I'm taking that leap of faith that so many previous Lexus owners have taken. $46K is nothing to laugh at. Comparable SUV's are $40K or less, but no Lexus logo. ","The vehicle rides high like a truck or a mini-van. A definate plus for those who like to ride high. Ride is very smooth and the interior and exterior finish is very refined. Not as much as the European counter part, but best of the Asian bunch. Talk about having all the bells and whistles, the RX350 has them. Auto head-lights, auto wipers, auto temperature, auto windows, auto seats, auto locks...I just have to drive the car. Keyless entry system is also a nice touch. Also, the only 5 fluids that you can check are Oil, Coolant, Brake, Power Steering, and Washer fuild. No Transmission dip stick. Almost everything under the hood is covered up. Zero user servicable. A definate plus for fe. 
","Color selection was limited at the dealer. Between the 4 levels of options and interior and exterior colors, I had to compromise on the final vehicle. Ended up with more options that I wanted, but got the discount from the dealer. If you like to service your own car (for cheap) this is not the car for you. First off it uses the hard to find 0W-20 motor oil. Also the oil filter is just a filter without the housing. You'll want to invest in a Toyota filter wrench for around $20. Transmission dip stick is missing. Transmission service is only possible at a dealer or a mechanic shop. Your man meter will hit an all time low once you open the hood of this car.

Have never had any major or minor problems! ","My 2013 RX 350 AWD is so different from my previous 2012. It handles better, gets better gas mileage, and overall, I like it better. It has all the bells and whistles except the Mark Levinson sound system. I love the new interior color (Saddle) just wish there was more of it than the black dash and doors. I especially like the way the rear door can be opened/closed, using either the fob or by pressing the interior button. Due to various driving conditions where I live (Idaho), I buy a vehicle that is AWD. Lexus AWD is great.This is my 3rd RX and I feel that they are a nice comfortable vehicle and very reliable. Handling on snow and icy roads is good. And I love the looks/style of them! 
","The height that you can raise the driver's electric seat up to has been REDUCED!! I am very short and I need to see over the dash to have a good driving view. My older RX had a higher seat and that is why I continued to buy Lexus RXs besides the lumbar comfort of the seats. The leather seats in both my 2012 and 2013 RX are OK, but do not go up high enough, so I have to use an additional cushion. I have both heated and air conditioned seats; they are not as comfortable as are the heated/air conditioned leather seats in our Ford F150 PU. This same ""con"" held true for my IS 250 C. This is for the ""butt"" section of the seats only. The back and lumbar support is excellent.

The V6 with the 6 speed transmission is silky smooth and as an enthusiast with many BMWs in my past, I don't find the steering feeling vague at all like some experts say. After the turbo issues and turbo lag on my previous SUV, I am no longer a fan of turbo engines and relish the Lexus V6. Also, the dealership we bought it from, Plaza Lexus, was VERY low pressure and gave me the feeling of pampering and a relaxed atmosphere so rare in buying a luxury car these days. The fit and finish on this vehicle is excellent. ","This is our first Lexus and we traded in our BMW X3 for it. The ride is much better than the X3 and the engine is much smoother. We've done several long trips in our 2013 AWD RX350 and averaged 23 mpg, which is amazingly very close to the sticker mpg. I bought the Lexus for the reliability and so far it's lived up to its name. The seats are very comfortable on long trips and the car is very quiet at highway speeds. We've been in snow three times with it and it performed very well using the snow launch setting. The backup camera is excellent and easy to see even in high sunlight conditions with its recessed location. One of the best sound systems in any SUV I tested or have owned. 
","I wish it had a little more cargo room than the 80 cu ft with the seats down. The USB port is a little difficult to get to in the center console.

Service dept tried to give me a 'closed' ticket and I demanded that the problem of the radio needed to be clearly stated on the service ticket and it should be treated as an 'open' ticket, they promise to follow up and contact me once a fix was available.

Nothing profound there. Mercedes felt solid but was too small. Cadillac had power but the cabin felt cheap and plastic-y. Land Rover was great but didn't come with many extras. The RX 350 just sort of grabbed us. We have a BMW 328i and this is a good complement -- a nice (different) driving experience, great comfort, etc. We really prefer the BMW's iDrive to Lexus' Remote Touch, even though some reviews state the opposite. The Lexus system can be frustrating for us, but we decided we could learn it. And that may be the only down side for us. I have to say, the dealership experience also made this an easy choice. Free car washes, airport shuttles, a cafe, lounges, arcade and clothing store are nice touches. And, as we did the paperwork, the dealer was holding a fundraiser for abused children. That the car is great was key, but we like the dealer as a business, too. ","Fit and finish, comfort, ride, power

The Ecco-Boost engine is world class, but have not yet checked gas mileage. If you want refined comfort and safety, I would recommend the MKT. You will enjoy a quite smooth ride in refined comfort, and a powerful and effective electronics and sound system. No worries at all about controlling everything by voice, it works! The big panorama sun roof was not something I would have ordered on a car, but since it was on the car we brought, I have come to really like it. Let's a lot of light in the car, and the actual sunroof is larger than normal. ","I have owned many other cars such as Cadillac, Lexus, or Equus, but I think my MKT may be the best car ever! I say "" think"" because only time will tell. I have driven the MKT for about three months and love it. I was interested in safety and comfort and the MKT delivers big time. As an older driver, I appreciate all the safety electronics like adaptive cruise control, blind spot monitoring, etc. that take a lot of work off the driver. Even with my well defined southern drawl, no problems with speech recognition at all. The ""cool"" seat feature has me spoiled. This is one smart car with a lot of computing power. 
","Not much to dislike. The center console seems a little hard to open, but that may be because it is new, or perhaps needs an adjustment. The voice recognition system commands have a learning curve, but Lincoln makes it easy. I have not moved to ""expert"" mode yet, but hope to soon.

You would be hard-pressed to find a better luxury crossover anywhere right now, and we have tried them all. We were going to get the Mercedes E-Class sedan, but after test driving the Lincoln, we realized that our choice was being guided by a sort of snobbery - we couldn't believe that we were actually preferring a Lincoln over a Mercedes. But the fact was, we felt better in the MKT. And having just driven it halfway across the country and back, I can say that I don't regret it one bit. This is an extremely responsive and well-appointed car, and it gets a lot of attention - I have been asked about it many times, and everyone compliments it's looks. (We have the Black Tuxedo paint, which looks especially good in bright sunlight). The voice system needs an upgrade - it is quite glitchy (went out on me several times during my trip) but when it works the way it's supposed to, it's excellent. ","Extremely comfortable, quality ride, with all the sophistication and technology expected in high end automobiles. Manipulation of seating and controls is outstanding, with great lumbar support, heated AND cooled seats, easy steering wheel controls and voice command options that allow for almost unlimited fine-tuning of your ride. The power you get with this Eco-Boost engine is amazing - a very large car with a sports car feel. Acceleration is top-notch, and comfort is better than you will find in any other luxury crossover. Has the feel of a sedan when entering and exiting, and the panoramic sunroof gives the entire driving experience one of open, luxurious travel. A great, underrated car 
","The voice commands are a bit cumbersome, and the system can be glitchy. The third row seats are for small adults or children only. It does take a little while to get used to the large size of the car. It drives like a sports car, so you can easily find yourself going well over the posted speeds, but that's not really a fault of the car.... just be sure to watch your speed in the early going. A bit big for some parking spots and garages.

I do own (not lease) a number of new cars and typical buy a new car or two every year. While I can get bored easily, the MKS is a keeper for the reasons that I mentioned above. Hopefully the high rating on the Taurus SHO will carry thru to Lincoln. My advice is to drive all cars and make your own decision. At the end of the day the only opinion that matters is the person who will be driving the car. Buying a car because you can afford it or because it appears to betrendy is a waste of time and money. Buy something that serves your needs. ","I owned a well equipment 2010 MKS Ecoboost for several years.

The vehicle trim is much nicer, and the adaptive suspension gives me the option of riding with a more sport-tight suspension and steering gear.

If you're on a highway, you might have 8-10 miles before you can exit. The system freezes during trips sometimes too. It can leave you stranded. I've had it repaired, updated and replaced. Finally, Lincoln acknowledged that there is an issue and a fix. They fixed it. A few weeks later...same thing. Navigation system is a major reason not to buy.

The salesman did a good job of going over all of the options, but it's a lot to remember. As I drive it, I occasionally need to look up exactly what to do - for instance, the remote start. When I got in, I kept accidentally shutting it off, until I read that I have to press the brake and hit the start button at the same time to keep it running. We purchase new cars about every 3 years, so I've had a lot of new cars, but this is my favorite.

I have test driven every hybrid including the new Lexus ES and MKZ wins hand down for comfort, ride, styling and MPG. The MPG is spot on. I'm averaging 42 combined. There is no hesitation when in EV mode at 60 MPH, as compared to the Lexus ES, which rides like a tarted up Camry (and lets you know when your in hybrid mode). Interior is smashing and the quality of the seats beats the Lexus' text material. Lincoln offers the best value for the dollar, which in the end, is what many buyer's will use to compare the MKZ against the the competing brands.On the road, the Z-Brid has great pick up. Put your foot down and she moves. I've put 1500 miles on MKZ thus far and over 500 of the miles I've driven have been PURE EV miles. My Optima Hybrid achieved 40% less than the advertised MPG.

","That while the technology has been available for sometime, U.S. car makers were too SLOW to act in coming to market with a decent hybrid. GM should simply be ashamed of themselves for killing their own EV years ago. In other words, U.S. car makers lost market share by not voluntarily bringing their hybrids to market before the imports.

Most review comparisons that include the Lexus 350, Mercedes Benz 300+, Avalon, Audi 6, BMW 5 series and especailly the 2015 Cadillac CTS don't include this car. The reviewers try to discredit this vehicle. Maybe the other car companies pay better for skewing reviews or maybe it's because those other car companies' vehicles are all beginning to look the same and so want to keep it in the family. The cars listed are way over priced and over hyped as compared to the Lincoln MKZ. This is not a race car. It is a luxury car. The other brands compare their vehicles to speed and thrill. That's why one of my other cars is a true sports car. I wanted a true luxury car and that is what the Lincoln is. Also, the employees at the dealership weren't arrogant butheads and went out of their way to accommodate us. Our MKZ listed at $51K. We traded in an 11 yr old vehicle and drove out paying $37K. Amazing! ","This car is beautiful. I purchased the technology edition with the 3.7L engine and the panoramic roof. The interior is awesome and reflects what a vehicle of the future should look and feel like. The lines are smooth and flowing both inside and out. The seats are the most comfortable seats I've been sat in and the ride, even with the larger rims, is quite smooth and very quiet. The finish, both inside and out is exceptional. This vehicle has so many advanced and ergonomic features, I can't list them all here. You need to drive one for awhile to get the full experience. One of the neat things is the fold down rear seat and trunk pass through. The dealership was exceptional. 
","Nothing, Nothing. When all the other luxury brands are beginning to look alike, this vehicle stands alone.

I hope that the significant improvements to the Lincoln brand can resurrect it just as Buick has done. Owing to the favorable pricing, the quality interior and all the do dads that come standard, the great gas mileage, and the trouble-free driving for the first 6,000 miles, I heartily recommend the hybrid and would buy another without hesitation. ","Although my gas mileage is around 37.5, which is considerably less than the advertised 45 MPG, it is still pretty good considering the size of the vehicle. Interior is nice looking, and the lack of a shifter in the console allows for extra storage space for wallets, spectacles, phones and other stuff that one can't find a place for in conventional console arrangements. The seats are comfortable, there is lots of space for passengers in the back, it hugs the road, there is adequate power for the unexpected maneuver, the sound system is great and the icons/buttons are much better placed than in previous MKZ's. A big thumbs up to Ford for pricing the hybrid the same as its gas only version. 
","To save weight and improve gas mileage, the gas tank is less than 14 gallons - the smallest of any vehicle I have ever owned. Because of the location of the batteries in the rear of the car, the trunk space is quite small - I could barely fit my golf clubs in sideways. Because there are air bags in the side of the front seats, the seat back storage pockets are very small and hardly of use. Although the car is very quiet (it's easy to sneak up on people in parking lots and have them jump up in the air), there is a decided noise when accelerating onto the freeway and you can tell it's only a four-banger.

I have received numerous positive comments on my Lincoln MKZ. It is fun to drive and is still has all the luxury options you could want. I have been really impressed with the quality inside and out. The seats are plush, the inside dash presentation is great and ambient lighting provides multiple color options. I love the oversized moon roof option.

I go 550 miles between fill-ups on commute type driving, a mix of highways and surface streets. The interior feels awesome. The leather is nice, the wood trim is a nice touch and the sound system with Sirius rocks. I opted out of the Nav system and have no regrets. The control panel makes it so easy to boost your mileage. I'm convinced that if the same panel was available on all cars, everybody would get better mileage.

I am not disappointed. This grand touring model with all its features was materially less expensive than the Ford Escape, and more fun than the Subaru Forester. I strongly recommend the cargo mat and the all weather mats to protect the flooring, especially if you have kids with muddy feet in and out all the time, or are planning on going skiing or any other activity where the outside mixes equally with the car's interior. ","This vehicle performs as expected. It has the Zoom Zoom factor, and handles well, even around tight corners. In the end it is a cross-over, however with a higher center of gravity. It remains fun to drive. The electronics work well. The adaptive headlights are a nice touch and the high intensity beams provide brilliant light. The interior is functional and easy to navigate. Gas mileage has been better than expected in the city and on the highway. City has been about 24 for my Grand Touring model, with the highway at about 33. The sound system (Bose) has also performed better than expected, with excellent HD radio performance. 
","In other posts people have commented on areas of cheap materials. These are clearly apparent in some of the plastic, the carpeting, and some of the minor details where more substantive materials could have been used. I was not entirely prepared for the lack of some of the storage compartments that I became used to in my other car. This will take some getting used to.

Now I have no negatives, sure the fuel economy changes (from 32-34 hwy to 29-32 hwy for me). But with the increased power this car is way awesome to drive.

It was noisy, I was not impressed with the acceleration, or the ride and I thought the interior was chincy and cheap for the asking price.

Will it be okay in the western snow? That has yet to be seen, but if it's that bad, I stay home, or take out the ole 1999 F-250 7.3. I'm a normal guy, that likes normal things, this fits the bill. I've had the 2.5 over 100mph, and it got there pretty quick (quick enough for me), and the auto tranny is smooth. If you want speed with the ultimate styling, buy a Jag XK-R, they don't make a SUV, yet, but for the money, you can't go wrong with this rig. ","My CX5 has or equals the best styled SUV's in this class, to me, style means a lot. There are always improvements that can be had, but as a whole, pretty darn impressive. I didn't get the tech package, no need, and for the money, not worth it to me. I settled for the Touring, with the BOSE sound system and sun roof. Milage is about 30 mpg, I live in WY, the roads are pretty straight and the speeds can be in the 70+ range often. The CX5 has the power to provide the speed, and the cornering is good too. Reasonably quiet on the inside, depending on the road. I don't care about the navigation sys, anything you have to look at to operate, is to me, a distraction. It's comfortable and roomy. 
","I have a small vibration in the dash on the drivers side while driving on dirt roads, no where else. It was real noticable when I first got it, but it's going away as the dealer said it might, we'll see. For 14K more, you can get a Lexus or a Caddy, is it worth it?

Overall, a good vehicle. Pickup is good, comparable to the V6in the Escape. Mileage is better, though not as good as some on here indicate. In town averaging 23-24 mpg. However, in winter cold, mileage has dropped to 20-21 mpg. Use of remote start in bitter cold for 10 minutes, mileage drops to 18-19. Sound system is good, but not as good as the system in the '11 Escape. Some on here have complained about the Bluetooth connection. I have been using Pandora and the system works fine. Unlike satellite radio (ie Sirius), Pandora is coming through your cellphone first, then to the onboard system. Any problems I have had are with my Android phone connection to Pandora, not with the system built into the vehicle. The winter rubber mats which came with the car (or as an option) are definitely worth getting. ","Appearance, pickup, around town mileage. Haven't had a chance for long highway trip to honestly evaluate highway mileage. The passing/change lanes warning system is a great feature except that when you put on your turn signal in an off highway situation, things like sign posts, etc. can trigger the alarm. 
","Probably nitpicking here but, interior lighting is poor. The ""glow"" indicator for buttons on the door panel for windows, locks, etc and on the steering column do not exist making it difficult to find buttons in the dark. The ""trunk light"" is on a side panel so you don't get much light in the storage area. Storage is poor. Door storage bins are built to hold 1 pint water bottles, useless for anything else. Cup holders are back to back instead of side to side making it a pain keeping track of drinks with a passenger. Center console is too low to rest your right arm on.

Rear cargo space is good, so thinking of loading bulk items is pretty easy. My ears liked the Bose, despite what others have said. Frankly, driving it was down right fun! 
","The in-door storage was a bit scant. Rear visibility through the inside window is not ample, but with the rear camera, it took the problem of seeing when backing up.

I've also been the proud owner of two Tributes previously, which I loved. My CX-5 is an amazing vehicle and I couldn't be happier with it! To be honest, I was very disappointed when the Tribute was discontinued and wasn't all that thrilled about looking at its replacement. Once I drove the CX-5 I was hooked! Gone is the 'truck' feeling of the Tribute and in its place is a smoother, zippier, FUN car to drive!! It has much better gas mileage as well. It's a tad smaller than the Tribute was, but it more than makes up for the space with what a sweet ride it is! I highly recommend this vehicle.

They too had not initially considered the CX-5, but once they did, they were sold. It too has become their vehicle of choice. Our mid-level version is well appointed, nicely styled, and came standard with useful safety features for a young driver. The blind spot monitor and back-up cameras work great. The radio system is very intuitive and easy to use. Bluetooth is a snap to connect. The seats are comfortable and very supportive. There is also plenty of room in the backseat and cargo area. Most notably this is an easy car to drive. The driving position is high enough to give you good all around visibility. The CX-5 is an excellent small SUV and well worth a test drive. ","We purchased our 2014 CX-5 AWD 9 months ago and it's been a superb vehicle with no problems. We first test drove comparable SUV's (namely the CRV and RAV4) and being a longtine Toyota owner had initially settled on the RAV4. Once we drove the CX-5 (as an after thought) the competition was over. The RAV4 had a very stiff truck like ride while the CRV had a way too soft towncar feel. The CX-5 has a very balanced feel, nimble steering with excellent road manners. Acceleration is very good with the 2.5L engine and performs well in the DC Metro area. There is plenty of power for the beltway/highway. We've also taken it to the mountains and it is a blast on graded gravel roads. 
","No issues, though I have one regret. I do wish I had priced the Grand Touring version. We initially purchased the CX-5 as a car for our teenager as well as to have an AWD vehicle in our stable, but it has become the vehicle of choice in the family and the extra amenities/luxuries (heated seats/moonroof) would have been nice.

Opted for the all-wheel drive model, and while certainly not sporty, it does get the job done while obtaining decent MPG's. Interior is incredible, and feels much more inline with much higher priced German crossovers than other Japanese equivalents. Quality is top notch, and the styling is ahead of its class in my opinion.

Recommend the tech package highly. The bells and whistles on this vehicle are superb and you won't be disappointed. Warranty includes oil changes, which I never heard of before. The mileage ratings are the best of all similar vehicles and it has been true to form. The rear view mirrors have blind spot detectors with light and sound, back up camera is great, moonroof beautiful, navigation, audio, and bluetooth systems excellent. Heated seats and easy, easy controls and great displays. Wheels are gorgeous. The engineering on this vehicle is amazing and it is so much fun to drive. I read about it in Car & Driver and then went for a test drive (3x before the final decision was made). I took several months researching AWD SUVs, crossovers, etc. before making this decision and test drove 7. Anyone buying new should do the same. I hope this is helpful. ","I purchased the 2014 Mazda CX5 Grand Touring in September 2013 and have about 6K miles on it so far. The ride is smooth, responsive and so comfortable. Previously owned a Ford Escape, but this time narrowed choices to the CX5, Rav4, CRV, and Mini Cooper Countryman for an AWD SUV. The Escape did not make it into the final 4 with its price points and mileage. The Mini Cooper was super, but takes higrade fuel only and is a bit smaller than desired; the 2013 CRV fell out with the ride and video screen, but must say the Rav 4 was a very close second. However the CX5 won big time on styling, interior features, theSkyActiv Technology and 2014 model year availability. Love the way it purrs. 
","Personally prefer a column shift location, but that's me. Also wish it came in more color options, and especially options with the light interior, which I prefer to black seats. Bought crystal white pearl mica with sand leather interior and it is gorgeous, but never thought I would own a white car. Now I am thrilled.

Price played a role, with about $4K off of msrp. Wanted an good dog hauler that would also be good for a road trip. Got the i 2.5 engine for better milage and reliability, and find the performance is plenty good, though I can hear the engine working during hard accelleratioin. Otherwise, a quiet, tight interior. Visability from drivers seat surprisingly good. Averaging 25.5 actual calculated mpg in mixed city/highway driving, which is about 1 mpg less than the trip computer says, but still, pretty good. On interstate drivng, getting 30 mpg. NIce electronic goodies such as bluetooth and rear camera.

Would not say I am unhappy with the car or regret buying it. Still, for the amount of money we paid, I expect nothing short of perfect. Finally, this is not a reflection of Mazda per se, but our local dealer was the worst...did not know anything about the vehicle, no follow up, no dealer prep check list. They could not get us out of the lot fast enough. In three calls since then to the service/parts deot, the phone rang twenty times before it was picked up. Tech. said everyone else was out to lunch....ttruer words were never spoken!!!!!!!! ","good looking Great views, front and rear. Love the ""lane change"" warning light. Have not used it on snow and ice yet so don't know about traction control, handling etc. Very nicely appointed interior. Have the leather seats and find them very comfortable. Took it on a 1000 mile road trio and found it quiet and handled well on highway. I tow a 16 foot fishing boat behind the car and it tows as if nothing is hooked on. Very good pulling ability/power, Tons of room behind the second seat was the selling point for us. We can leave the second row of seat up, and the two dogs have lots of space behind that to hang out on road trips or store runs,. 
","Really disappointed in the quality of the sound system. We got the Bose speakers but feel as if we are listening to an AM/FM station from the 60's. Owners manual needs an English teacher to re-write and clarify. Very vague and confusing. After five months, still can not figure our the navigation system or the heating/air conditioning controls. Paint job is pretty bad. I had a 04 Ford Ranger without a scratch on it and, after three months, already have three significant scratches and two dents in the rear bumper area and door panel.

","Acceleration of this 273 hp vehicle isn't as powerful as my 265 hp 2004 Maxima was. Also, it needs a compass or direction indicator in the mirror - am I driving southeast or southwest, or south? Also, incoming calls thru Bluetooth mostly get disconnected. Also, if I turn down the temperature 1° from 90° to 89°, the system switches on to air conditioning and also changes the direction of air flow.

I feel that Mazda has but its best foot forward on this car. I did not drive the Mazda 3 with the less horsepower, so I can only say that the 184 hp is more than adequate. The automatic transmission feels like a CVT but is not bothersome. I have not had the car out on a long road trip, so I do not know what to expect as far as gas mileage but expect the EPA figure of 39 to be about right. Overall, I would enthusiastically recommend this car to any of my friends. ","I have owned this car now for almost 3 months and have driven it 3500 miles. This is a fun car to drive and actually enjoy driving this car more than my son's '09 BMW 335i. We bought the Mazda 3 Touring with the stronger 184 hp engine because we like the sportier look of the 18"" alloys and the Soul Red Metallic Paint. The car seems to have more than enough pep for everyday driving, but will not win any races. I have received many comments on the looks of the vehicle (all positive). Gas mileage is a positive. My usual round trip commute is 75 miles (about 80% highway-driving 65 and 20% city) and routinely turn in 37 MPG. 
","It can be pretty windy where we live, and the car does get knocked around by the buffeting winds. Noticed that the MPG against a strong wind drops into the 32-33 range. The car has some road and wind noise, but not too bad. Being 6 feet tall, it is a little bit tight for me getting into the car, but once I'm in it has plenty of leg and head room. Have not figured out all the electronic gizmos yet. Not much to dislike about this car. Our Mazda 3 was one of the first 4 door versions at our dealership so we ended up paying sticker price minus a $500 Mazda loyalty rebate. This is the first time I have paid that close to sticker.

A lot. My initial short list was Civic, Accord, Mazda3 and 6, and the CX-5. I dropped Civic and 3 w/out even looking, thinking why go small when small family is growing? So we're down to three cars. Dropped Accord because, well, they're somewhat boring even though I fully trust them to run forever. (Not like Mazda's are poor, but I still place Honda ahead by a nose in quality/reliability). I was left with CX-5 and Mazda 6. Took the Cx-5 for a spin; nice, but somehow felt a little cheap (by Mazda standards) when compared to the 6. Plus, being totally honest...I am shallow and feel that the CX-5 will look ""dated"" in roughly 5 years while the 6...well, the 6 just looks like a design that will continue to appeal long after the next trend(s) of design come and go. Here's hoping, anyway. ","Car looks far more premium than others in class/price range. It's smooth, moderately quiet, and the acceleration is there when called upon (I have the manual, for added control in that regard). Fuel mileage is solid, I can average 30+ mixed if I drive nice, 25+ if I drive like I want to. :) 
","These are more nitpicks than true flaws. Compared to my '07 Mazda3, this car's steering wheel controls lack a mute button as well as a radio mode (AM/FM/CD) button. There could be maybe an extra inch or two of rear leg room by shortening the trunk, which some call small for this segment, but I think it's more than fine. I have the Touring, would like to have lumbar support control. It's a bit redundant to have touch screen audio controls, controls on wheel, and a commander knob, too. Commander should offer AM/FM/CD switch if wheel controls don't. Seriously, I have no real beefs though. I wouldn't complain if the armrest on the driver door extended in toward driver by another .5 - 1 inch.

I have the Dunlap tires and the road noise is minimal. (Judging by my Bluetooth testing I don't have to yell while driving for the other party to hear) Maybe buyers should avoid the Yoko's which the other review states are noisy. Because this car is quiet. As another reviewer stated the car is smoother in turns than it is going straight ahead. Transition from a 280+ HP V6 to this engine is not difficult. The car is not nearly as quick as the 6 cylinder, but I have yet to find myself wanting or needing more power.

","The infotainment center isn't nearly as bad as reviews claim. True - it's NOT intuitive. NONE of the reviewers read the manual because it can do just about everything they said it can't. It's simply not intuitive - you have to read the manual carefully to get the most out of it.It's also sort of hard to get in and out of the car due to the slanted windshield and cramped space between the steering column and the front post, even when the tilt and telescoping is fully up and in.

No, it's not as fast as a Porsche, but it is way cheaper to maintain and frankly unless you're taking it on the track every day the power is certainly above average considering how light the car is. My 1993 Miata only has 116hp, and only weighs 250lbs less. So, the power to weight ratio is much better on the 2013. I preferred the GT over the Club because of the heated seats, xenon headlights, etc. Also, I chose the soft top over the PRHT model, mostly because I store these cars for the winter. Why carry the weight around for no reason? This is my 4th Miata, and I also own a 1993 (NA body) Miata Limited Edition in addition to the 2013. I've also owned a 1994 NA 1.8L, and a 2005 LS (NB body). The NC body car (2013) is far more rigid and comfortable as a touring car while giving up nothing to the early cars in regards to handling. ","I have to admit right away that I am a serious Miata enthusiast. Mine is a Grand Touring soft top (lighter!), loaded with every option other than the automatic transmission (why would you?) I love the handling, and the ride comfort / rigidity of the body shell is leagues above the early cars. Yes, they are heavier but unless you drive them back to back it's truly not perceptible. The heated seats sell the GT over other styles, and I have the appearance package which adds the front lip and rear diffuser from the Club package. 
","There is not much to dislike, at least for me. It had a rear differential issue very early on which was taken care of by the dealer promptly. This is why I could not give it straight 10 across the board. Otherwise, it's been totally rattle free and trouble free.

I lament the passing of the Rx-8 into the history books but I look forward to its much anticipated successor (you know which one I'm talking about). With the Skyactiv-rotary engine on the horizon, the Rx-9 will not only be an amazing car, it will continue the tradition of amazing vehicles coming from an amazing company.

I hate that the tires are so expensive, but that's a trade off; I probably wouldn't burn through them so fast if I drove it more conservatively. I do wish the car had (then optional- now standard) cruise control, but it wasn't like I didn't know ahead of time. It's an inconvenience, but a tolerable one. I hope to keep this car for many years, and have little doubt that I'll get another. The only reason I give it an 8 or recommendation is that it's clearly NOT for everyone.

","Even the Spyder GS version looks really nice (GT version is nicer). 18"" rims come standard, of course you can always buy nicer rims. Great fuel economy. I enjoy driving with the top down, since it is Southern California. As good acceleration as you can expect from any 4 cylinder engine, especially for the weight. Great handling and at taking turns. Comfortable front seats. The price and fuel economy were also the selling points. Pretty good sound system. Obviously great visibility with the top down. The sound system also adjusts when the top is down to hear more comfortably without having to raise the volume. 
","There are a few: The backseat is pretty much useless, so look at this car as more of a two seater and not four. In the off chance you have people sit in the back, they have to be particularly small. I would recommend the Coupe/Hatchback to adequately carry 4 people. The trunk space as well is limited. Then again, I knew this when I dediced to buy a convertible. If you really want a convertible, and are willing to deal with the limited space, this is for you. Also, the subwoofer is located between both of the back seats, so that can be a little distracting. Limited visibility when the top is up, so you REALLY have to check your blind spots for small cars and motorcycles.

I can see why the EVO is legendary . This suv has the same ALL wheel drive. In snow, it gives me great confidence. Just don't listen to the jornalists who disklike mitsubishi and do not give this suv the credit it deserves. They would say it is ugly and has V6 instead of the turbo and not mention anything about the all wheel drive cabalities. Because it does not look nice in thier eyes, the try to diss it. my felow drivers, drive for your self and draw your own conclusions. ","Nice power and fuel enconomy for a V6. very smooth power train. Excellect all wheel dive. Had lots of oppurtunity to test in in a few snown storms. Much better in snown than my rav4 and wife mazada CX-5. Mine has the Super all wheel drive. The paddle shifter are nice when you want to have fun. FYI, still using orginal tires. Also drove to ottawa and back during snow storm. Currently have 20,00 KM. also, this is one of the best handling and ride balance SUV. 
","Sometimes, the steering is a little slow to come back on center. Most drivers will never notice this as i drive it hard and corner fast.could use more storage inside. The sunviser should have extender.

It was down to the Santa Fe, Rogue (2014) or Outlander. I am both a Nissan and a Mitsu person.

Got the Outlander - had the best warranty and the ride / handling is similar to the Rogue. Wanted a 3rd row for emergency - but 95% of the time, I am the only one riding in this car. I am getting excellent MPG - up to 36 MPG (I drive in a restricted zone - 45-50 mph) but in combined regular driving, I am getting 29 MPG. For some reason, it came out the cheapest - with the most features at this price level - so excellent feature/price ratio. ","1. Great fit and finish2. Excellent warranty3. Feature content (ES only - with Fuse Bluetooth, heated side mirrors, 3rd row seat)4. Smooth acceleration (CVT)5. Quiet ride (little road noise)6. Excellent gas mileage

The ride and handling compensate the lack of unnecessary luxuries. ","I like the look. The size (real mid-size truck). Value for the money. I like the ride. I like the lot of aftermarket accessories that can be installed. I like my color (blue pearlcoat) - color changes according to the light. Mine is the Big Horn, 4X2. I like the clearance, its high. I like the MPG (mostly good for its size). Tows like an F-150. Bedliner and towing pkg included on mine. Essential equipment in the cabin. Easy to clean interiors. Did not needed the power seat option because the seats are enough high. 
","Transmission could be better in terms of the shifting and overdrive. The underbody is not protected by skid plates or undercoating, so I can see may be sweet for rust - just take it to somebody for doing a undercoating job. The radio of mine was very basic.

Warranties and parts will need to be sorted out, but my Saabs should still be good for another 10+ years and then become even rarer. I've owned many high line cars in the past, many that were very highly regarded by the automotive press, only to sell them within 6-12 months because they were very over-rated in my opinion.

Hirsch makes a software upgrade for this particular car so down the road I will be able to add 40 BHP adding to this car's already engaging drive. It has been terrific to drive either around town or out on the highway. Everything is logically laid out. Great drive! Quick. Handles great! Comfortable! Long range with large tank, regular fuel, and great gas mileage! Although Hirsch upgrade will require switch to premium fuel. 
","No spare tire! Although one can be ordered and there is a space for it unlike the run-flat cars and their corresponding lack of trunk space for a spare. The automatic display lighting is too sensitive to exterior lighting and makes the light switch between high and low too frequently especially when traveling under tree canopies. There should be a defeat setting for this. Rear visability can be an issue as can side vision due to width of ""B"" pillars. Not impossible but takes some getting used to.

I have owned my car for about a month and it gets great gas mileage and is really fun to drive. I have not seen another one yet so it is still unique. I can’t wait for the aftermarket parts to stat becoming available. ","The FR-S is fun to drive. The car is unique not everyone will have it and it stands out. I get a lot of positive comments. For the price I think it was a great deal. The Scion pure pricing made my purchase easy. I don’t understand why others are comparing this to the Nissan 370z as it is not in the same class and is not meant to compete with it. The 370 new base starts at 34k this is 10k over the price of the FR-S. You need to compare apples to apples. I can buy a used Porsche Cayman for 30k as well which will out due both cars, but I wanted something new and the automatic has great gas mileage. Being a Toyota/Scion and Subaru product the reliability should be great as well. 
","The back seat is useless, but that is expected the trunk space is okay. This is a great weekend or spare car I would not use it as a daily driver. The car is tiring to drive on long trips as the suspension is stiff and you feel every bump. Wish the cup holders were placed a bit more forward, or the power outlet to the back of the tray. The BeSpoke touchscreen is a bit hard to navigate when driving, steering wheel controls or buttons on the unit would make it better. The analog speed gage is useless good thing it has a digital one.

You'll love it! ","It's a great car for both playing on back roads and cruising on the highway, where it gets an honest 32-33MPG even at 80. The interior is spartan but has everything you need to enjoy the car. The rear seat can carry two additional folks for short trips, though I must admit it's a squeeze for all. The fold down rear seat actually makes the car a lot more utilitarian than you might think. As for driving, it drives like you always thought a car should. It's not a race car but it's a blast to wind through the gears, zip through corners, and even goose the rear end out a bit when the opportunity presents itself. 
","I went with the standard stereo because the premium one wasn't fully compatible with the iPhone 5 and didn't really give me anything I thought was worth it. The two issues for me are that one, controlling the phone through the head unit is just ugly. The controls are a pain to manipulate for either music or phone, so I end up using the phone. The other thing I'm not thrilled about is that there is no satellite built in. I hear it's an add-on option, but really this should just be something that's there IMO.

","CVT transmission is lacking low-end torque, but isn't bad once you get moving. Ride and handling from the factory was a bit soft, so I added the rear sway bar which made an enormous difference. Interior lighting is pretty weak, but not usually problematic. Seats are probably the weakest part of the interior; not much in the way of bolstering, padding or ability to adjust, but generally fine for the type of driving I use the car for.

As a second car for commuting the IQ is perfect, it's 3 to 4 inches taller than a civic or corolla so you don't have to crawl in or out of it, the big 16 inch wheels make man hole covers and small pot holes a non issue, the steering is great and the ride is decent for a small car, even the sound deadening is pretty good.

The CVT transmission is also a perfect match for this car, a quick sprint from 20 to 50 mph is right now, no hunting for the right gear like in a six speed automatic. I also added the interior light package which gives you a lighted scion door sill and added floor lights which help with interior lighting and look cool too, but there expensive.

","This car is the direct competitor for the Honda Civic Si. The difference is the tC runs on regular unleaded, and the Honda requires the expensive hi-test fuel. The performance is about equal to the Si Civic, since I tested both cars before deciding. The Civic was more flashy, with gimicky dashboard lights, which costs about $3,000 more. No thanks, keep your Hondas! The tC has typical Toyota reliability, which is excellent. Fuel mileage is 33 on the highway and 27 in town, again regular unleaded, yeah!

The car wouldn't go into gear well as an automatic and a speaker in the door started having a short in it. I had only had the car for 3 1/2 years and the calendar went out on it and it was going to cost my over $5000.00 to get it fixed.

I really became attached to how easy it was to drive this car in traffic and park so I bought one for myself and love it. ","I live in the city so it is easy to maneuver thru traffic, but especially park. I never have a problem finding a convenient parking spot. Gas mileage in the city is great also and I can go a month without filling up. When I do it cost me a fraction of what I used to pay filling up my Lincoln LS V8 sedan.

I bought the car new in 2009 and I have only approximately 15,000 miles on it because it doesn't go on long trips. Insurance rates are low. Kids will wave at you which is good or bad depending on your perspective. A comfortable and useful city car - not equipped for distance traveling. ","I like the size. It fits into my golf cart garage. Quickly heats up in the winter and cools down in the summer. Plenty of room for cargo as long as you're not trying to move big or tall objects. Seats and interior are comfortable and roomy for city driving and I have never had trouble keeping up with traffic even at 75 to 85 MPH in Denver. Good mileage and easy to park and turn. The exterior panels are not metal so your car will never show parking lot dings. Safety features are impressive. I used to drive a Miata which is a lot more stylish but is a death trap if you get hit. I feel a lot safer in a Smart. 
","No cruise control and rigid seats make it uncomfortable for long drives (over 100 miles). It gets pushed around in a stiff wind. It has a relatively short warranty. I was told to put only premium gas into it and to use synthetic oil. My biggest issue: After I bought my car, the Mercedes dealership in Westminster CO took Smart away from the Smart dealership in Denver (to increase their combined fleet fuel ratings I suspect). I really liked the original dealership but Mercedes does not care about Smart! If you're going to buy a Smart, check out the dealership's commitment. Some Honda dealership will service Smart cars.

As battery capacity improves, I see this technology being the de facto standard. I remember back when I was a kid and I was purchasing my first PC. The computer salesman told me that I had two options... the 20 MB hard drive and the 40 MB hard drive. He recommended that I get the 40 MB hard drive and that would be plenty of digital storage to last me a lifetime!! Well times have changed, and we now have hard drives in the hundreds of GBs and we're now getting into Terra Bytes! As battery technology improves, I see electric vehicles using Tesla's technology surpassing gas-powered and hybrid cars with much greater range. Even the ability to recharge quickly will vastly improve with time. Remember this is only first generation! The wave of the future has started! ","I received my 2013 Tesla Model S mid-size battery with supercharging option and it has been an amazing experience! I highly recommend everyone to go see these new all-electric vehicles at a shopping mall near you. I'm getting a consistent range of over 220 miles per battery charge, not being overly conservative and punching it every now and then, and this is plenty to get around Orange County and Southern California. I drive about 50 miles to and from work everyday, along with occassional trips to the supermarket and such, and I'm able to use it for 4 full days before plugging it in. Tesla recommends I recharge everyday in my garage, but I wanted to test its limits initially. Very impressed! 
","A little more planning was needed when I took a weekend roadtrip to San Francisco, especially since this is the mid-size battery version. In the end, I was able to use the Tesla supercharging stations to fill up for free within 45 minutes and the hotel I stayed in San Francisco had free charging for electric vehicles, albeit slower than the supercharging stations but I left it charging overnight. In the end, the entire trip did not cost me a single penny in electricity except the wear and tear on my tires, but some additonal planning is needed to hit the supercharging stations and other public charging spots.

For a test drive around Mercer Island, I was little hesitant to push the car through the turns like I would with tip-tronic cars. To offset the that control I was put in a high regenerative mode that slows down the car faster without applying breaks which gave me little more feel through the turns.

My local dealer offered me an INCREDIBLE, mind boggling deal to trade my Genesis Coupe for the BRZ and as much as I wanted the BRZ and that deal I passed it up because of the poor quality of the interior and the convenience package. I know the premise of the BRZ is to be a stripped down sports car like the Lotus Exige, but if Subaru is going to take the time to put a nav system, bluetooth and voice command in the car they at least need to make them more usable and not so frustrating. Reaching to find a tiny button to engage controls is not safe, especially when you're having so much fun whipping the car around. Please, Subaru, upgrade the conveniences and put some controls on the steering wheel!Even todays moderate priced cars have good convenience packages, but the BRZ falls well short. If they ever fix that I'll buy a BRZ. Until then I'll stick with my Genesis Coupe. ","I test drove a fully loaded, white BRZ Limited the other day and was considering trading in my 2013 Genesis Coupe 2.0T Premium for this car. IMHO, the looks of the BRZ are fantastic and I prefer it to my Coupe. The car handles great, although I did not try to push it or let the back end hang out during the test drive on some twisty back roads. The steering input and response was great, and so were the brakes. Overall a fun car to drive. Trading off the turbo for better handling would be an adjustment, but I could get used to it. 
","The overall interior quality of the car is poor. The plastic dashboard and console looked and felt cheap. I thought the interior of my Genesis Coupe was poor, but it's still a lot better than the BRZ. The navigation system and voice command on the BRZ are clumsy and not easy to use. The audio quality of the stereo was also poor. The BIG problem was that Subaru did not put any controls on the steering wheel. So whenever you want to engage voice command or control the volume or playlist of your iPhone you have to reach to the center console and find a tiny button. In my Genesis Coupe I can keep my eyes on the road and slide my hands to the buttons on the wheel. Door running boards were flimsy.

I sell cars, and I get to drive an exorbitant amount of vehicles in a month's time. The BRZ just did not wow me at all the way I was hoping it would, and I was disappointed. I feel like this car has the potential to be the next hottest car on the market, but there are a few areas that need to be refined to really hone in on that potential. ","I love the handling, hands down one of the best handling cars that I have driven. It has nice pickup for a little H-4 engine, and it'll definitely scoot through traffic without issue. All controls are easy to access and use with little thought and distraction from driving. Good visibility overall. 
","Now I have to honestly say that this is probably one of the most cramped vehicles I have been in. I am 6'4"" and I understand that this is a little car, but so is a Miata, and I fit comfortably in that. What helped to increase that feeling was the way the bucket seats hugged the body, which for a performance enthusiast is important. But the seats had little to no cushion so it kind of sucked. I also HATED the gearbox and shifting. This car is a 2013 model, and the construction and shift smoothness pales compared to anything else in the same class that I have driven in the same model year.I also hate the look of the rear lights... but that's preference.

I got out of my 2012 Forester lease early to buy this vehicle and it's my 3rd Forester. The car is more solid and the CVT transmission is quiet and delivers greater than the mpg stated. The info center has about 6 screens you can look at and I actually find myself driving slower in order to push the average mpg envelope displayed. ","I love the transmission and fuel economy! Getting rid of the 4 spd automatic for the CVT made all the difference in performance and reduced noise level. The car also feels more solid than the 2012 Forester I used to own. On the highway I am getting over 32 mpg and in the city 29-30mpg. The front passenger seat no longer has height elevation; however, my wife, who is just 5', claims she can see better due to a higher fixed seat position and a different slope on the hood. I love the back-up camera (Premium model). Subaru should put that on all their vehicles, regardless of trim level. 
","This may seem lame but the only thing I don't like about the car is the position of the driver's floor mat. The anchor points are too far forward and when you rest your foot on the mat, it touches the anchor prongs that hold the mat in place. It needs to be pushed back closer to the seat frame. For some reason Subaru actually extended it forward. The front doors are larger to allow easier access but you have to be careful that you do not whack a parked vehicle next to you.

But how can you buy and drive a vehicle with substandard seats??? Lacking in cushioning, thigh support and side bolsters to hold you in place, while turning etc???

I have owned many brands of vehicles, never once was I in a Toyota, Honda, Nissan etc., that had a problem like this. It's mind boggling! And I have found many others on internet forums with the exact same complaint. Second, The Navigation and electronics package is inferior to almost everything on the market. There are cars 3 and 5 years older with far superior systems to this ""new"" Subaru system. It's really infuriatingly bad...

Did they forget how many of these are potentially going to be sold to Australians, Americans & Big Europeans? Also the rear seats are like a simple bench. No design, cushion, support etc. You can actually see this, just by looking at them, before you even sit down! Did Subaru run out of money? Did the designers quit? The second thing are the Navigation and electronics! This should be a no brainer for a Japanese company? HUGE FAIL! Old, Difficult and Cumbersome!

When you need to do 60-70mph on the freeway the Impreza does this with ease, dip the throttle and your going where you want to be.

At first i was not impressed with the car, even though the interior was a good improvement over the previous generation Subarus. I'm not a fan of hatchbacks, but after driving it for a bit it started to grow on me. The biggest improvement aside from the interior was the fuel economy. However there is a noticeable lack of power when you are passing someone on a single lane road, So time and patience is required in these situations, something the previous 2.5i did not require. In around town driving the car feels peppy and from what I have gathered it doesn't really need to rev the engine to get all the power (it doesn't really make any more above say 4500rpm). This is perhaps the biggest difference vs other imports such as the Civic. Standard options are great and the stereo is an improvement but still mediocre at best, cargo space is excellent.

And as a hardcore Sportbike rider that's not easy to do with a car. ","If comfort features and smooth easy ride is what you want then look somewhere else. But if you want a practical AWD car with performance at a decent price then look no further. The car's AWD and engine are balanced and provideconfident turning and performance in it's 2.5L Turbo. The back seats are comfortable and the room is spacious for children or adults and storage in the sedan's trunk is sufficient and the hatch provides slightly more space. Dollar for dollar one of the best values out there for a do everything performance car. And the exhaust note is fantastic from the flat 4 turbo engine.

","The Subaru WRX is fundamentally a mechanical vehicle. There are no computers taking decisions out of the drivers hands. The 5-speed manual transmission is smooth, the AWD sends power equally to front and rear wheels, and there is power to spare when you need it. The hatchback version has plenty of cargo room, especially with the rear seats down. My two very large dogs have plenty of space to lay down. I bought the Limited model, which has leather seats, but there aren't a ton of frilly extras, which I like. 
","Not a lot of storage space. There is a small console behind the gearbox (which loses precious space with two power outlets), two cup-holders, pockets built into the doors and a small storage space under the A/C controls.

Time will tell how trouble free it is, but Subaru does have a good reputation. Also, it is built in Indiana by American workers (non-union I suppose .. which is a plus in my book). The engine and CVT are built in Japan, but some GM cars have foreign built engines too. So far ... no problems and good performance (after 1300 miles). ","Drove Saturn SL2s for 20 years prior to getting a 2013 Legacy. What a huge difference in comfort and performance. True, I get about 2-3 mpg less than I got with my std. shift Saturn SL2, but the CVT is so smooth ... it is what sold me on the car. I live in a snowy region, and the AWD will be a plus come next Winter. Very comfortable and will seat 5 full sized adults comfortably. 
","Nothing that I really dislike about the vehicle as yet. Well, I know I will miss the polymer body which came on my Saturns, guarantying that there would never be any exterior rust. Had my last Saturn 13 yrs. with no rust. Some how, I doubt the Subaru would be able to duplicate that feat. If GM hadn't discontinued the Saturn line, I might still be in a Saturn. However, after about 1300 miles, I can say I'm very impressed with the Legacy.

The mid cycle changes are great. Love the new electroluminescent instrument cluster and having the temperature gauge. Miss the compass in the rear view mirrow, but the rear view camera in the radio is a great trade off. Had it in deep snow and it was ever bit as good as the older 3.6 R. New design of the front end with the large fog lamps is also a nice improvement. If you want an Audi Allroad at 10000 less and a significant lower cost of maintenance, this is the car. You and your pocket book will love it. ","This is my second Outback, first was a 2010 3.6 R limited which has been truly an excellent car, plus 50000 miles and not a problem of any kind over the time we have had it. It went to my son who is in college, and I got the new 2.5i PZEV limited. I was a bit concerned about the smaller engine, but I was assured by the service manager where I got my first Outback that this new engive and new CVT were significant improvements over the older model and that I would love it. He was right. The new changes are great, especially the rear view camera, improved suspension, and better mpg's. Have 2300 miles on it and have gotten 28.7 mpg overall. I love this car and would recommend it to anyone. 
","No doubt that the 2.5i PVEV is louder and a bit slower than the 3.6R, but it only takes a few hundred miles to get use to the difference. The gain in mph compensates for that small deficiency. Never have been much of a fan of the fake wood trim. Liked the old dark trim much better than the new redish mate finish. Folding mirrors should be electric. Passenger seat should be 10 way like the drivers seat.

This car solves that problem and lowered my insurance premium. The new wood grain looks more like real wood, since it's not that glossy plastic. I have 10,000 miles on it and it drives great, especially on long trips on the hwy. with the eyesight set. The GPS screen is big and the stereo is much better than previous models. Even the gas mileage is better on this model, average 24mpg in city and 29mpg on hwy.

AWD does work well in winter. The rear seats are roomy for my teenagers as I hate being kicked from the rear. The cargo space is great for all of my kids travel sports gear. With the rear seats down, the cargo area is surprisingly spacious. I moved twice in my outbacks! 
","CVT is annoying but that's the trade off for good AWD gas mileage. The CVT takes an inordinate amount of time to engage into drive from backing up and seems mildly dangerous waiting to engage. Watch for passenger seat plastic rails to come off on leather models. It's as if the leather material is too thick for the seat plastics. It has come off on all 3 of mybleather seated outbacks and legacy models since the redesign of 2010 and it can't be fixed. It just comes off time and time again.

I can live with the dislikes I mentioned above as all cars have their quirks and I am more interested in long term reliability. I bought the Outback because of the AWD, price and Subaru's history of quality and durability. My other vehicles are 4WD but the Outback's AWD is much more convenient, and it performs well in snow. Overall, I would recommend this car and plan to keep mine for a long time. ","Looks great for a station wagon. Interior is well laid out and comfortable, with plenty of room for my Great Dane. 4 cylinder with the CV transmission has a lot of pep, a pleasant surprise.. Handling is great and I really appreciate the AWD system, don't have to worry about shifting into 4WD in the snow. Overall price was reasonable and Subaru really seems to care about quality and reliability. 
","This car is noisy! The CV is noisy at low speed, which is no big deal. But, the suspension is very noisy on bumpy roads. I thought something was broken but the dealer says everything checks out. I expected a much quieter ride. Also, the sheet metal seems flimsy. When I wash it the roof, hood and lower quarter panels all flex under slight pressure. The standard sound system could be better.

But who really wants to put a dog, sports gear, or anything wet, snowy, or muddy in a luxury car?I tend to drive to maximize the mileage, but it has power to merge or pass when I need it. Sure, not as much as our V-6 Tribeca, but then again I averaged over 26 MPG on a 1000 mile road trip with 4 passengers, a full load of cargo, and a cargo box attached to the roof rack while averaging > 70 miles per hour.

We have always sworn by Subarus (this is our 4th), but wished for improved fuel economy. This car delivers that and is fun to drive.

This car is a true crossover vehicle, providing an excellent mix of rugged SUV capability and safety with sleek styling and MPG of a car. Other vehicles in this segment like the CR-V, RAV-4, CX-5, Rogue, etc. don't live up the versatility of the Subaru Crosstrek. Interior is roomy and simple, doesn't look or feel too cheap. Great gas millage. High safety and reliability ratings. High projected resale value. 
","If you're doing your research right, you've probably come across some bitter biased reviews saying how the car is weak and underpowered. It's not, its adequate, and there is a huge difference. If the car was underpowered, you wouldn't be able to pass cars on the freeway and you'd probably accelerate out of a red light as fast as an 18 wheeler.

Love the automatic car starter too so it will be nice and toasty when I get in when it is cold and snowy out. I also like the clearance this has off the ground. With the seats down, it has a huge amount of room for packing up for a weekend getaway. My mountain bike also fits in the back with the seats down and I can get it in and out easily. 
","I wish it ""took off"" faster. I guess that's the sacrifice for wanting a 4-cyl with great fuel-mileage. I wish it had power seats instead of manual. I would have liked to have an auto lift gate option on my key or even inside instead of having to do it manually. And an overall Subaru downfall is that it being ""dog tested, dog approved"", they do not sell any seat covers for the back seats to help with nails (especially on leather seats) and shedding.

So far this has been a fun car. I bought it just as winter ended, so I haven't gotten to test it out in the snow yet. In heavy rain it handled excellent. It was like the roads weren't even wet. I was really impressed. I love the gas mileage. I have the limited model, so it has leather interior, backup camera, bluetooth, etc. It's the perfect car for me.

Hands down better service than the Mercedes dealership trade in came from. Dont promise what they don't deliver and very organized. Buying any car, no matter how costly, is a compromise. I have been through many vehicles and this one is a very pleasant surprise. Much like past Volvo and Bmw without the quirks and upkeep. I would recommend as a heavy use second vehicle (like our old minivans were), First vehicle for an outdoorsman for camping ( not four wheeling) or retirees looking for something different. Makes a great interstate commuter for me driving from rural to urban. Both sons, 20,24 like the vehicle as well as my wife and I. Winter should be fun. I will buy another Subaru, either another Crosstrek, Forrester or Outback when our Mercury Mariner or Mercedes need replacement. ","Super commuter vehicle. Fun to drive. I have put 13000 miles on since June 1st purchase. Back seat is great for long legs my sons are 6,4 and 6,3. and comfortable for family of four extended drives. Easy to commute with heavy traffic; can see out well, Handles well. Limited model black orange. Seats comfy, interior subtle. No nonsense. Much like one of my old jeep Wranglers grownup. Plenty of room for dogs and assorted farm junk. Mileage runs about 35 with steady interstate 75 miles an hour. Controls at handspan distance. 
","Still not used to CVT transmission. Not bad just different. Would like lumbar support. A mishap not to include in Limited model. Black interiors should be across the board with all exterior colors. The cream was beautiful but wouldnt stay that way long with kids and dogs and limited my color choice. Speakers are subpar for a premium radio. Stereo touch screen needs to have ability to enlarge icons and simplify by temp delete icons normally not used by old guys like me.

The car isn't particularly fast at least with a launch, but it feels fast. I can definitely go adventuring in the car with my friends but at the same time it's stylish and good for a night out on the town without lethargically absorbing gas. My biggest complaint would probably be that my best friend has managed to leave about 90 million of her boot prints on my glove compartment......I have no idea how. ","It's definitely more a teenagers car than it is an adults car, I can say that still sort of being a teenager myself. The ride is a bit more feely and it's not meant to go fast, only sound fast. My parents definitely feel more comfortable with me driving it, the lack of a quick acceleration and the typical Subaru badge of toughest (and safest) thing on the planet. My XV came with a gps which definitely helps me get around to school, work, home, and to the nearest slope or trail with my friends. The mileage is pretty amazing to. Even if I want to push the car I still get about 350 miles per tank but average about 400-450 so it's pretty easy on my wallet at the pump. 
","Wind noise is definitely a bit more than I expected. It makes the car feel faster than it is but sometimes it can be a bit annoying. I'm definitely going to research a way to quiet the ride a bit.

Please!.....Who says 89 gasoline and a K&N air filter can't be used? The same people probably don't know how to manipulate the CVT either!You folks just know how to ""floor it""... right? I love this thing on the highway, at red lights, and on hair pin turns. Its a very stable vehicle which has precision and control. ","I think the combination of the CVT and the 2.4 HO motor is well matched and the car manages ALL the power without loosing grip. Do a 25 mph doughnut in AWD mode in a empty parking lot you will see what I mean. Yeah, It handles that good.Mash the gas pedal and the tires do not break traction... The Launch is perfect. The power goes to the wheels and there is no tourque steer. love it! It took me five minutes to realize this is going to be a fun ride... and its sharp too!This car is really fun to drive. It puts a smile on my face everytime I use it!GREAT JOB SUZUKI !!!

I refer to it as a truck because behind the wheel this is really what it feels like. The new 4Runner doesn't drive with the car like feel you get from other more car based CUV's i.e. the Grand Cherokee, Ford Explorer, Chevy Traverse or the new Nissan Pathfinder. The 4Runner really stays true to the SUV feel and performance. One note if you off road at all is the turning radiance is wide due to the long wheelbase so keep that in mind well picking your path on the trail. However the long wheelbase makes this truck a really nice ride on the road. It's much more comfortable than a traditional truck. The only things that left me wanting was for a transmission that made better use of low and mid range torque or a V8 option. ","The 4 runner has a huge cargo space and comfortable seating. Being one of the last few body on frame design SUV's on the market, and one of the last few with a true transfer case it's fairly capable off road well providing a smooth ride on road. The breaks are excellent, and the headlights provide really good viability at night. The fuel efficiency really exceeded my expectations I'm averaging 19.3 mpg with mainly city driving. 
","The V6 feels like its struggling at lower speeds to get the truck rolling but one you're over 40 maintaining speed is no problem at lower elevations. Living in Colorado I do find that when climbing in the mountains I have to manually down shift the automatic transmission to produce enough torque to pass on the highway. Toyota really seemed to engineer the transmission with fuel economy in mind so the truck doesn't feel like it has a lot of low end grunt to it, most of the power comes in around 3500 to 5000 rmps.

Dealer told me that this 5th gen 4runner is back to it's roots of being a 4runner and no longer on the path to family CUV like previous generations, I think I agree with this statelment. I think it's a great overall vehicle for my needs and still has some decent creature comforts like automatic climate control, dual climate, 15 speaker JBL stereo, 'Party Mode!!!' Wooohooo! ","Appearance, it's a guys SUV and not a soccer mom/old lady SUV (ie Lexus RX/Audi Q5/Highlander/Honda CRV etc). It's utility is awesome being body on frame - it's a truck. It can actually go off road with confidence, it's more than just a van/car hybrid which is what most SUV's (really CUV's) of today are. It's a Toyota (can hopefully get a fairly trouble free 200K out of this truck)! Ride height and ground clearance are pretty good right out of the gate (ie stock). Good amount of interior space.The dash flows and placement of all items make sense. I have the upgraded 15 speaker JBL system - it's worth the extra money. Opteron gauges are easily readable and pretty nice. 
","I don't mind the V6, it's pretty strong, but really wouldn't mind a V8 (but I suppose you'd take it in the shorts on the gas milage). Would like to have HID's (though standard bulbs will be much cheaper to replace).

If the front speakers rattle via the metal coverings, be sure and ask that they address it before you drive out or you'll kick yourself like I did. They were NOT too keen on putting me in a new car with this issue at Toyota of Dallas. I was very let down with their service and lack of concern. ","It's an eye catching car and truly beautiful on the road. I've received several compliments on it so far. Good gas mileage for such a large car. The 500 watt stereo, picks up some fine detail in the music. Nice heated and cooled seats. Much improved NAV system. Very easy to set up. All door unlock is fantastic, by merely touching the driver's door with your hand (easy change in the settings!) Heated back seats is a nice addition. Love the rear window visor. It really cuts down on interior heat in the summer. It's a better looking interior and exterior than the Lexus 350. More sporty and sleek. Inside dash is awesome. Turn OFF the beep (in settings again.. cause Silence is Golden!) 
","With the 500 watt stereo, I have to keep my Bass on the LOWEST or it will rattle my front speakers. The casing around the front speakers in the DOOR is a metal cover that rattles when any song has a LOW Bass response and it drives me crazy. It rattles unless you put your hand on it while driving to keep it still. Sadly, there is a rattle coming from the passenger back seat area that I can seem not locate. I need to take my car to the dealer and have both these issues addressed. I Love the car.. but there are 2 things needing attention. I feel Toyota needs to do a Recall on that 500 watt stereo system till they can fix the rattle in their LIMITED model.

It is basically the Lexus ES 300h without the $5K extra for the badge. A professional reviewer said that the Lexus ES looks like the box the Avalon came in, since he thought the Avalon had better styling. I have been waiting for this car to come out since Toyota first offered the Camry Hybrid in the 2007 model year. I am glad they restyled it in time for the hybrid release. Great job by the domestic stylists who designed this car. ","The quiet, rattle and squeak free ride, excellent stereo with great iPhone interface (for hands-free calls and music), fit and finish, leather interior (standard), limited features (rear sun shade, rear seat heaters and 3-zone climate control.) I have had the car for 10K miles and am averaging 38-40 mpg per tank, with commuting and short trips around town. I always use the sport mode. 
","The only minor thing I dislike about the vehicle is the standard tires (which I think are a dealer specified item.) My dealer used the Bridgestone Turanza tires, but a friend of mine got the same car and he got Michelin Primacy MXV4's. The Michelins are a much quieter and better handling tire, but not really a strike against the car. Also, at least in sport mode, the front end is a little loose, but I know this can be fixed with a front strut tower brace. I just don't know if they will ever make one for this kind of car. Most drivers probably wouldn't notice this.

Space is great for the family.Seats are comfortable& all have heating & the front has ventilation. Navi is intuitive & it incorporates traffic too. Speakers are great. Sport mode really gives some spark. Love all the leather. Safety features are great! I like the back-up camera & all the technology in the car. Drives great. 
","Maybe I am picky, but a few more cup holders would be nice - maybe in the back doors on the bottom? Also it's low in the front, so you need to be careful in deep dips on the road. I wish Toyota would give a longer Sirius subscription to enjoy with the car - 3 months is too short - and longer warranty. Lastly, I can't find a ski rack for the top yet.. maybe soon the manufacturers of racks will come out with one to fit the new model body.

Also the transition from engine to electric only is a lot smoother than the prius (barely noticeable) and braking was smoother than the prius. I test drove the Camry LE hybrid, the Camry XLE hybrid, the Prius 3rd generation, the Avalon hybrid and the Lexus ES-300h hybrid. The Prius ride and comfort was spartan compared to the normal sedans, but there was no real difference in ride comfort or road noise between the Camry, Avalon and Lexus; hence I bought the Camry XLE. The XLE seating is much more refined and more comfortable than the LE and the electronic package in the XLE is better too. I thoroughly enjoy driving this car. ","I own the XLE, my daily commute is 80 miles with 50% highway and 50% rural roads--my average MPG is 44.1 which is higher than the EPA rating! The bluetooth feature in the XLE was intuitive and easy to setup with my Iphone 5. The audio system sounds great too. The seats are very comfortable and I especially like the leather. The interior is refined and pleasing to the touch and the ride is comfortable and quiet. 
","The built in NAV isn't very user friendly--its not intuitive like a garmin or tomtom. The voice activation features is hit or miss (like all other voice activation systems).

At this point I'm getting 40-41 mpg--unbelievable for a car this powerful. Has great interior and feature-packed dash. Very roomy--i'm 6'3"" and 300#, no problems. Was wanting one of these for a while and Toyota just ran them briefly at 0% financing so I snapped one up. Cosmic gray mica actually looks like a very dark blue with speckles. I figure at over 40 mpg I'm saving about $120 a month over my Highlander. My payment went down too on the trade-in so it was a good business deal. If you see these at 0% finance, grab it! ","Fantastic mileage, great JBL stereo with subwoofer with good punch--10 speakers, great legroom, nice dash with stitching and good fit, good ride and very easy to drive. Mine had a sticker of $35,400 and I paid 32,000 at 0% interest. 
","The XLE is missing the rear sunshade of earlier gas models--arghh! No window tinting either--I hate the lack of privacy from the rear.The engine sounds funny and takes getting used to-sort of groans and winds down as it accelerates unlike a normal engine that winds up. The brakes feel funny. The gas pedal feels small. At first I thought the style was sort of boxy but it's growing on me.

While it was fun to drive, I'd recommend the Auto if you buy one. The only time the gas mileage changed was when we pulled a 2,700 lb featherlight camper trailer and we achieved 6-7 mpg and a max speed of 65. As a long time FJ40 & Toyota enthusiast, I really, really, really, wanted to love this vehicle but I think they got the design only 75% right. The Jeep Wrangler nailed it with its 4 door removeable top. Just wish it had a Toyota Powertrain ; ) If Toyota addresses some of these concerns shared by MANY with a model update, I would consider buying another one. Otherwise, sorry Toyota. ","Good power and handles real nice for a 4x4 in this category. styling is pretty good overall. 
","We owned one of these for 2 years and while I overall enjoyed it, it was inconvenient with children or any rear passenger for that matter. Getting them in and out in parking lots was kind of a joke. You have to do a little dance to get the doors open and kids out without dinging the car next to you. Ultimately that is what made me sell mine for a Jeep Wrangler Unlimited. I also didn't really enjoy the rear seating. It feels very claustrophobic like you are in a cave.

The absence of interior carpet makes for easy clean up without sacrificing style or comfort. This vehicle is a reliable friend in ugly weather, powering through snow, mud or windy conditions.

Rain - please this is an FJ and it just relishes the wet. Streams - well here it gets interesting. I have gone through streams and roads overflowed with water where the wake went over the hood (yes over the hood) of the FJ about 3 inches above my wipers. How is this able to be done? The FJ's main air intake is located in the passenger front wheel well and has louvers faced downwards to drastically reduce water intake. Have fun with your J - I sure have. ","The FJ can handle easily anything you throw at it w/o any issues. I can take multiple bikes allong with a canoe on top with a full vehicle set to bring along my family of 5's camping gear and it all goes along easily.I hunt and and when I go out to check possible spots the FJ can go where a lot of other vehicles cannot.

","Very smooth ride. Lots of creature comforts in the Limited. Great fit and finish compared to my Venza. I liked that SUV but the loaded Highlander is just another world above. More space and legroom for the driver than Venza. Great sound system and display. Very comfortable power seat. You feel like a $million driving this vehicle but I paid 38k and change. Add in 0% financing and it's plenty of SUV for the money. I looked at more expensive Lexus models but this is a great ride and lots cheaper. I love it! 
","Getting 20 mpg, about 2.5 mpg less than Venza, if gas goes up for good it might get costly doing my usual 50-mile days. I had a 2008 Highlander limited and this one has the same, odd-sized p245/55r19 tires. I found out before these are pricy ($300 ea) and don't last long (25-30k if you're lucky). I since learned you can put p255/55r19 tires on it with lots more choices. I'd be happy if the Limited had more mainstream tires. Not much to complain about other than gas and tires. I wish the loaded hybrid models were less pricey, and I wish the SE models had smartkeys available--would have given more choices. Once you drive with the smartkey for a while it's hard to go back to a regular key.

Currently the car is situated with just the two seats in the second row (Stow N Go feature) for my children's car seats. Love that it is roomy and the trunk space is great.

Despite some harsh criticism, the Prius has been an excellent, reliable family car that has saved me time and money. The Blue Tooth is great and the basic audio system just fine for me. Under better circumstances, I would have gotten the Plug-In or the Prius III or IV with the bells and whistles that I prefer. As it is, I am happy with my Prius II. Besides, I got a GREAT DEAL!!!A performannce car it is NOT! The Prius is an excellent family car that gets you from point A to point B. You'll save on gas and maintenance and help our environment. Beware of the visibility and start up/alarm kill-switch issues!!! ","I get very good to excellent gas mileage in my 2012 Prius II. On flat driving surfaces the car exceeds the mpg that is listed. I was surprised to get 50+ mpg on congested San Diego and LA freeways. Short trips in a cold Prius and hills reduce mpgs. That describes my usual driving. Overall, the Prius has saved me a lot of time and money at the pump compared to my previous VW VR6. My VW was a BLAST to drive but killed my new family at the pump and with excessive unscheduled maintenance costs. That said, I was looking for savings at the pump and RELIABILITY. The basic Toyota Prius II has done all that after one year of ownership. 
","Unlike the solid ""thump"" of a VW, the door panels on the Prius vibrate and sound hollow. While the interior is roomy with comfortable seats, the cloth upholstery soils easily. The interior plastics all look cheap. POOR VISIBILITY is a MAJOR CONCERN! Invest in a backup camera/sensor.I did have ONE SERIOUS ISSUE with the car. On three ocassions my new Prius would not start when pushing on the POWER button. The car alarm kill switch prevented me from starting my own car. I discovered that if I reset and then deactivated the alarm with my key fob, the car would start. Toyata took care of the problem after the second time when I informed them of my findings on the internet.

My goal was to get a gas sipper that had a good safety rating. So I traded for the Prius. And I'm glad I did. Despite negative reviews for things like its aging looks or unrefined finishes, I'll say that I am enjoying the Prius just as it is. I got the level 3 version - backup cam, nav system, etc. and enjoy those features tremendously. While not a sports car, sports utility, or even a MAV, it is an amazing car that does what it is supposed to do - deliver great MPG. I'm very pleased. Don't take my word for it, or anyone else's, just go test it out and see for yourself. I wish I had known I would never get more than 37MPG in the Cmax or I would have most certainly just bought the Prius the first time. A great car with a very affordable platinum extended warranty. ","There are many things to like about this car. I purchased the level 3 version. It has the navigation and backup camera. It also has an HD radio and XM radio with a 3 month subscription. And it also has proximity locking where you don't need to insert a key to start the engine or unlock the doors. The build quality is amazing - absolutely nothing wrong with it from when I took delivery. I am really enjoying getting about 47MPG average so far on only 3 fill ups. The seats are comfortable and the finishes are not bad as have been eluded to in previous reviews that i read. The finishes are on par with other similar cars. (Do check it out for yourself and you'll see). 
","There is nothing about this vehicle that I'd say is a CON. It is different, no doubt, but nothing about this is a CON. I traded in a Cmax after about 10 months and 15K miles and the list of CON's could go on and on for that car. But going to a Prius was the best thing I could have done.

I loved both cars, handled well and the gas mileage was better. I have been exploring plug-in feature in the Prius and competitors.

I have owned the Prius (package 2/II) 2005, 2008, 2011, and now the Persona 2013 (Black Cherry is awsome). The 2013 is by far a superior product although I miss my 2005 for other reasons. Previous to owning a Prius, I owned a 1995 Nissan Maxima GLE. The Prius is by no means a sporty car, and the transition took getting used too - but once the Prius is cruising, it is about the same as my old GLE. Passing at speed is decent although definitely not the same as a Maxima. ","My 4th Toyota Prius. My 2013 Prius Persona has come a long way in interior styling. Still a lot of plastic, but made to look pretty nice in Toyota's effort to use recylable materials. The SofTex pseudo-Leather (pleather) is made very well and is similair to leather in many ways giving a comfortable feel and adds to driving comfort. Performance wise, everything is about the same as my previous 2011 Prius II. Moreover, the fuel effeciency seems to be slightly better managed in my 2013 than in my 2011. Overall, the MPGs are great, the comfort is pretty good, overall excellent. The Black Cherry color is really beautiful. 
","As with most other commuter/economy cars, road noise is still relatively audible. It is quiet overall - and you can talk on the car's bluetooth speaker and to other people comfortably without yelling. However, relative to other $22k to $29k cars of similair class, the noise is no more or less than others. I always thought Toyota gives great care to details, however, I feel the interior can still use some improvement especially for driver utilities and accessories like a coin slot just for those annoying tolls or when stepping into a convenience store for coffee. I was also slightly annoyed I didn't have other interior color options with the Black Cherry Persona trim.

So far I have not used the entune for more than checking the weather which is something I could have easily done on my cell phone.

Its some of the most bang for the buck you can get for a full hybrid vehicle that can do electric-only driving below 30-40 mph for a mile or two. Its great for city streets where idle time kills your fuel economy, yet the car doesn't drop significantly on the highway. The size of the vehicle isn't too tiny for practical use, I fit a recliner in the back by folding the seats down (the recliner was a two piece that came apart), and many larger vehicles without a hatchback couldn't achieve the same result. Acceleration is not an issue if you're not a speed demon. Since most people in the market for a hybrid and looking for efficiency aren't seeking 0-60 in 6 or 8 seconds, you'll be perfectly fine with the Prius C getting to 60 in 10 seconds. Ignore the ""professional"" reviews that bash this car, after 15,000 miles this thing has given zero problems. Its a great buy. ","The fuel economy of this vehicle is amazing, you will easily get 45-50 mpg consistently on the highway or city, in the winter it will average slightly less since the engine runs harder to warm up, but has yet to go below 40 mpg for an entire tank during my first year of ownership. It isn't uncommon if you drive with a light foot to get over 50 mpg consistently. Hands down, fuel economy is the strongest point for owning this car. In the sub-compact market, it also has great styling and features. Full GPS, satellite radio, push button start, lots of features to advise fuel consumption for only around $20-22k. And you can do full electric at low speeds below 30 mph. Its a lot of technology. 
","The biggest con to this vehicle is the fact that some things feel cheap. The back seat has a plastic cover over the batteries (which are under the back seat). The car has some rattles and squeaks on occasion. But the styling is actually good, with two tone seats. There really isn't much else to dislike about the car.

Hopefully this will last me for a long time. I can live with it.. I'm new to the Toyota family so we'll see.. I havent been able to see how it handels in the snow yet but it does have a AWD and locking diff axle. I would not take it off road other than simple, gravel road stuff.. but who does anyway.. I have driven SUV's for about 15 years now and only a handful of times have I needed that.. so 99.9% is on road anyway.. ","Purchased a 2013 XLE Rav-4 about a month ago. I was very stong on the looks, Esp from the front view. The gas milage has been good. Im driving 70 miles a day to work which is 50/50 city and highway. Im averaging 26.8 mpg. I am a man that does a lot of outdoor activites. So far it has been able to keep up with my hobbies from Golf bags, Mt biking, and fishing with a 12 ft kayak strapped to the top..The seats and steering wheel are very comfortable. The interior ride is Very quite compared to other utes....Storage inside is very good and I hope long term quality will be there.. 
","Had the Toy for about a month now and a couple of items that I dislike have come up. The stero system sound is not what it should be. Hard to get the surround sound. the Speakers are no good. The gas tank seems to be small, typically can only put in 12 gal. The horn is wimpy. Meep meep.. Ride is a little stiff.. headlights at night have a sharp cut off.not a big deal but on hilly terrain it really notice it. There are soo many choices in this field and many are fine vechicles so its really just a personal choice of what you like.. what feels good to you!.. may not be right for everyone..

Of the 5 we test drove we were on agreement the RAV4 was it. If you are in the market for a crossover, for some reason, put the 2013 on your compare list. ","Our shopping priorities for a crossover were MPG and comfort. The RAV4 was second highest in MPG, but the comfortable size made it a know brainer. The performance of all the crossovers we test drove were nearly the same and all sufficient. The new design without the spare tire hanging off the rear door is a huge benefit in space and lower insurance costs. 
","I am not a fan of the tipped up edges of the hood as it seems to be less visibility if they were not there - I was told it was for aerodynamics but I think that is just more wool.

Interior materials are not what I expected, and while I prefer the liftgate to the swingout door, interior storage space has been reduced. The ride is much stiffer and bouncier than I expected especially since both the car I drove and my current car are on the same 18"" wheel and tire setup. Must be the suspension as my older car rides better. With crash test results and reliability issues with 2006 model that I own, I would not recommend the new Rav4. It is a car I want to like but just can't bring myself to purchase, as there are better choices on today's market. ","I currently own a 2006 rav4 v6 4wd, and I must say that it has not held up to toyota's bullet proof reliability persona. I have had multiple problems with this vehicle, that being said, I still like it. It's fast and gets 23-26mpg. I drove a 2013 limited to see if I liked it. While the front and rear seats are more comfortable and the front offers a better driving position with more leg room, I'm 6'2"", there just didn't seem like much has changed. 
","The new rav4 is not sporty at all, with the eco mode on I found myself thinking the brake was on. With it off, the car moved a little faster. Not a fan of the interior at all, the seats while comfortable, had terrible materials on them, and the new look of the dash and interior overall wore off before my test drive was over. The ride in the limited model I drove was beyond firm, downright bouncy, some people may like that, but my current rav4 on 18"" seems a little firm. When toyota said that the new rav was smoother that's what I expected, but it was way worse. Also recent crash tests from IIHS do not fare well for this suv in frontal offset crash tests.

Based on what I've experienced in my newer 2013 model, I am pleased with the vehicle but am waiting for the inevitable deep snows of a central New York winter to see how well the AWD works. We looked at Subaru Foresters, Honda CR-Vs, and Chevy Equinoxes, but the RAV4 beats them on ride quality and interior space. ","Good front seats with excellent support, very comfortable driving position. driver controls easy to reach, sharp looking interior and exterior trim, very smooth engine for a 4-cylinder, smooth-shifting 6-speed transmission with manual shifting for engine braking on hills, great audio package, very high value for the price compared to the LE trim, excellent split front air conditioning, excellent handling, outstanding interior space, outstanding steering wheel design with many controls incorporated into it, reasonably quiet for the type of vehicle, nice padding on the lower dash gives a quality impression, 10K mile oil change interval lowers the amount of used oil it will generate. 
","Lack of adjustable lumbar supports in front seats, lack of overhead heat/AC vents for rear passengers, non-sliding rear seat, so-so acceleration in the default ""Eco"" mode with a tendency to upshift at low rpms which make the motor often sound as if it is lugging; what appears to be low quality/durability Geolander G91AV OEM tires with no apparent treadwear warranty; sealed transmission prevents fluid levels and condition of fluid from being checked by the user; cheap feel to hard plasitc visors and dash, lack of the option to install a class I trailer hitch.

It is roomy, comfortable, convenient, fuel efficient and it handles and drives smoothly. The dual climate control works well as does the backup camera. I had to have real leather custom installed as Toyota does not offer it, but I am happy with the result. I traded my Lexus GX in for this car and I have not been disappointed. 
","The only annoying thing about this car is the eco mode which dulls acceleration and causes the transnission to shift around. Every time you start the car it automatically selects eco mode and you have to hit a button that says sport which is partially hidden on the dashboard, down low. This is difficult at night when you are driving along and need more get up and go. This is the only thing that I don't like which is kind of amazing.

The Sienna has the best reliability, acceleration, build quality, and better bang for the buck than the Odyssey. The engine is refined, and provides outstanding performance compared to the competitors. The 6-speed transmission is smooth and unobtrusive, and is standard for all trim levels, unlike some competitors. The power doors on the LE are very nice, with multiple open/close buttons. Some reviewers criticize the interior trim as cheap plastic, but it is simple & neutral, rather than trying to look like faux leather or wood. The simplicity also means less floppy and loose material to tear or snag. The upholstery is good-quality, comfortable and should wear well. The folding armrests feel more solid than the competition as well. The LE trim is comparable in price to the Odyssey's base model, but adds power doors, seats, and 3-zone climate control. Head-to-head, it beat all the competition easily. ","Understated but attractive styling - not too trendy or polarizing, yet modern and appealing. Interior feels very spacious. Acceleration is good - tested this and the Odyssey back-to-back, and the Sienna had noticeably more pep, even though they both are rated for the same HP. Like the built-in retractable sun shades. Feels stable and planted while driving. Stock stereo on the LE sounds great even without a subwoofer. Seats are very comfortable and adjustable. The overall feel of the car is very solid and well-built. The removable center seat for the middle row stows nicely in its rear cargo compartment niche 3-zone climate control is nice. Markedly better ride quality than Odyssey. 
","Biggest con is the location of the inner wheel well on the drivers side. It is too intrusive for my left foot; I cannot stretch my left leg out without backing the seat all the way up. Other than that, great legroom in passenger front & middle row. Rear-view camera screen is small. Bluetooth phone integration not as seamless as the Sync system on my Ford truck. Exhibits some typical front wheel drive torque-steer under heavy acceleration, but not too pronounced. Center-row seats must be removed, unlike the fold-flat seats on the Chrysler products. Doesn't have as many cool colored high-tech looking lights in the dash as the Odyssey, but that's a matter of function over flash.

While I was mostly a passenger during this time, I did get a chance to drive it. The Sienna was not lacking in power, and it handles as you would expect a minivan to.

I can never sleep in cars, but in this one, I COULD, for the first time ever. The highway ride is soft and quiet, a perfect vacation car. The climate controls are divided between the driver, front passenger, and the left captain's chair. The heat and air conditioning were perfect.

I love the way it drives and handles. The ride (for it being a truck) is smooth. It does well in turns and on wet roads. I can also haul what I need without a problem. I like the small compartments in the bed (see cons about bed liner). I like the fact that one of the seats has the plastic on the rear, that way my kid doesn't get mud on the back of my seat. The seats fold down easily and there is more storage space in this small truck than expected. My Bluetooth wasn't hard to set up, and I don't find it difficult to switch from one device from the next. 
","The sound system in this truck is horrible. I'm still iffy on the plastic liner in the bed. (I like the small compartments in the back, but after a while I'm sure it will just end up rusting underneath.) In the morning the brakes squeal. Not just a little but all the way backing out of my driveway (quite embarrassing since this vehicle is brand new). Previous year model problem so it should be fixed. I'm still unsure as to why only one of the bucket seats has the plastic on the back. I also hate the fact that every time I push the lock or unlock button on the remote, it beeps loudly.

That said, this truck is great even with the cons noted. I compared the Nissan Frontier with the Tacoma when shopping for a smaller truck. I liked the look and feel of the interior and exterior of the Tacoma over the Frontier. Toyota knows the Tacoma has no equal in its class right now and the Taco outsells the Frontier too. I purchased the Tacoma for many reasons including its history of reliability. The Ford F-150 and Dodge RAM were to big for my needs, the Tacoma is just right. I avg 16 mpg mixed with city/hwy driving. ","Size is perfect, not to big not to small. Back up camera is a must, ride is firm and doesn't beat you up even with the TRD trim. lots of storage space inside the cab and behind rear seats. 4.0 engine is smooth yet powerful, road/wind noise at highway speed is surprisingly smooth/calm. Plenty of front leg room for 6 foot + adults. Rear passenger head rests fold down and don't block your view while driving. DRL can be turned off or on quickly. Truck feels solid, no lose fitting parts or odd noise from inside the cab while driving. Touch screen radio display can be turned off while listening to music. Truck comes with Toyota's two year or 25,000 mile free scheduled maintanence plan. 
","A truck at this price point should include, a ignition light, longer turn signal and wiper levers and a LOCKING glove box, center console and tail gate. The steering column doesn’t extend far enough. Somebody at Toyota should be fired for engineering tiny door handles for the Tacoma, those handles belong on a 1995 Tercel! There is no front license plate mount, just two holes drilled into the front bumper. I was disappointed to discover my Tacoma was made in Mexico; other Tacoma's are made in Texas too.

I got the TRD sports package and love the way it looks. ","This truck handles almost as good as my Camry that I traded in for it, and it almost gets the same gas mileage. This week I had a chance to test it out in some major snow and it moved and handled through it like a dream. No sliding, or slipping and I felt comfortable and safe as it ploughed through the snow leaving other cars sliding to the side. The controls are simple but easy to locate and operate and the seats are very comfortable and supportive. I love how I feel in this truck and like the way it sits up high. It isn’t so big that I have to look for two parking spaces when I pull up somewhere, but yet it has the power to pull what I want. 
","The Bluetooth seems to be giving me some trouble and I am going to play with that more this weekend and figure out if it is the car system, or my phone. I would have liked some kind of step to get up in the back of the truck when the tailgate is open, but that is a minor concern.

It pulls my 17.5 foot aluminum bass boat without a wimper. I love the Bluetooth and USB connections, Don't need XM Radio when you can load your own music on a thumb drive. At the price I paid for it, Navigation should have ben a standard feature. Internal voltage inverter from 12v to 110v is a nice feature, 
","(1) Mine has two cigarette lighter accessory plugs, both of which disconnect when engine is turned off. One of them should be connected directly to the battery for a continuous power source. (2) I don't like the suicide door on the back of the Prerunner TRD, If you're shopping and a car is parked next to you, it is virtually impossible to load into back of vehicle without difficulty. (3) Engine is extremely loud when first started, settles down after a few minutes. I have a 1998 Olds 88 that has a quieter engine.

My first is an 01 Tacoma that I still own and has required nothing more than maintenace . Build quality is what was the major deciding factor. Drove the 13 F150, Ram 1500. Silverado 1500. Impressed with the Ford and Ram but the Chevy felt cheap inside and out.. Like the cab space in the Tundra double cab vs the F150 extended cab.. Also not a fan of the clamshell doors. The Ram was impressive but was concerned with build quality and reliability. Nice ride, handling and tight turning radius for a full size truck. Drives as good or better than the rest. 
","I have the 4.6 V8. A little better gas mileage would be nice. (16.5 -18 highway). Although I've had no issues yet, I'm told the paint quality is poor. Interior not as nice a the Ford or Ram but seats are comfy including the back seat. Would prefer the backup cam larger and in the dash vs. the mirror. It may be difficult to find a truck configured the way you like. I wanted a backup cam and small V8. Had to take the TRD and tow package to get it that way. In order to get certain options you have to move up to the larger V8 which can be a problem if you don't want it and the extra cost and less gas mileage, although most are sold with the larger V8.

It is a great looking, great riding wagon that flies in the face of the station wagons of yore. Stylish with aggressive 20 inch wheels, the 2013 Venza makes owning such a class of car fun, something my parents could have never said about a station wagon. And all this with the bullet-proof reliability and quality that comes standard with every Toyota ","There is so much to like about the 2013 Venza. First, the updated front fascia and darkened taillights make all the difference and worth the wait. I love the tall, cavernous, and cleverly designed center console. Well lit and spacious it offers plenty of storage and a slick sliding cup holder to make access easier. The gas mileage is above average given the weight (approx. 4,000 lbs) and HP of the V6 engine. The invaluable power tailgate is also a welcome and useful feature, especially given the lack of availability of such a feature on the Honda Crosstour. It has quiet and very comfortable ride that is certainly tuned more for comfort than for fun. 
","The carpet and headliner materials are cheap. It's especially disappointing in a car with a window sticker just a few C-notes short of 40 large. The seats, though comfortable enough, have very little to no bolstering and short seat bottoms that offer little thigh support. Its tuned more for comfort than for fun. The placement of the HVAC controls look like an afterthought. The soft, squishy brake pedal is a common Toyota trait. I wish for a hard plastic cargo tray.

The car has plenty of pep with the turbo that kicks in with great torque as low as 1,700 RPM. People buying this car aren't looking for it to be a dragster. Refined and sporty as they come.

The long and short of it is; do you live where a hardtop is really useful. I live in the northwest, and the main drawback of convertibles is they are kind of yucky in the winter. Not so this car! Its a bit slow off the mark, but makes up for it when you want to pass someone! The back seats are somewhat cramped; but thats the same story with other convertibles of its class. At least it HAS back seats, and that is an advantage in hauling things AND with the insurance companies. It has no real distinctive looks, like other convertibles. In fact, it looks very much like a standard coupe. And that was a strong plus for me. It gets great gas milage, but takes premium fuel. With the hard top up, its not quite as quiet as a standard coupe, BUT better than a ragtop. Great sound system, plenty of front seat space, good quality. ","You must pick what you like about a car before buying; and this is what I did. Mine is a 2012 with the interior leather. I love the large radio/media display, and this is the first convertible I have had that came with speakers that could be plainly heard even with the top down at freeway speeds! I LOVE the panorama see thru roof! I have been stopped from putting the roof down by people that want to film the process. After the top folds into the trunk, the car has exceptionally clean lines. VW gives you 2 types of mats; one that matches the carpet, and one (textured rubber) for bad weather. Interior (with top up) looks much like most cars, exterior too looks like a standard coupe. 
","As mentioned, I dislike the ""turbo lag"" between 0 and 20 mph, but expected it. A small price to pay for a turbo. The trunk really IS small with the top down. Again I expected this, and matching it against other convertibles, theirs aren't much better even though their trunks aren't housing a folding top. You have to make use of the back seat to make up for the small trunk space. (Although I DID fit in a 55"" television behind the front seats...and closed the top!) There is very little space in the center arm rest; although a connector for your Ipod or mp3 player is a plus. Handling is like a slightly larger and heavier car.

I am very surprised I don't see more of them on the road. Perhaps that has to do with the convertible more than anything else. I narrowed my search down to the EOS and the Toyota Solara Convertible. The EOS won hands down on every point of comparison. ","I have owned a 2009 EOS now for a year. Overall, it has been excellent. I'm 6'2"" and I do not feel cramped at all in this vehicle, even on a 2000-mile+ road trip. Performance is outstanding with the 2.0 turbo. My wife and I wanted a convertible, and this vehicle fit our needs perfectly. Our combined city-highway mileage is 28, highway mileage on that 2000 mile trip was 35. It has a baffle to eliminate the buffeting noise with the top down, or the sun-roof open. We love the rear seat baffle also, which stops the wind from hitting driver and passenger from the rear with the top down, plus it hides things from view in the backseat while shopping. 
","There is a flat-spot in the acceleration from a dead-stop. It feels sluggish until you reach about 20 mph, or the turbo kicks in. The reports I read about the EOS before I purchased it noted fuel-injection problems, and that did happen. We had one injector solenoid fail and replaced it. About 2 months later another injector solenoid failed. This time the dealer replaced the remaining 3 at no charge. Since then, no problems at all.There is some increased noise with the hardtop up on rough roads at low speeds, but we knew that up front. Hardtop convertibles have several pivot points that can cause some noise as they flex. My major dislike - my wife is always driving it, not me

You just have to get used to the rhythm of the engine performance since this is a diesel engine and do not abuse it period. This car should last at least 20 years in normal driving condition and mechanic visits when requires. Do NOT confuse this car with racing cars and never engage in any of that. DO NOT FIL YOUR TANK WITH GASOLINE (some people already did), and IF you already did by mistake, DO NOT START THE ENGINE WHATSOEVER..

I had a little issue with one of my previous Golf, but nothing that can't be fixed.. Other than that the car was great and performed well over all. These TDIs last forever.. 
","Usually the genuine parts are a little pricy vs after-market options if necessary. Therefore I would suggest to everyone out there, that you will NOT wait for the manufacture suggestion in order to change the very usual parts such as : engine oil and filter (original VW) with the quality ones and OBVIOUSLY at 5K miles instead of 10K miles as recommended. Don't go cheap, you will regret. Diesel engine filter at 15K miles instead of 20K miles as recommended. Air filter without any doubt at 15K miles, and the cabin filter.

While the GTI is no rocketship, it is fairly quick. Handling is superb. Braking is stellar. Comfort is outstanding for a car this size. Note in Europe these are premium cars, seen as more mid-size, whereas in the U.S., with all the leviathans on the road, it's a mere pipsqueak. Every time I get behind the wheel I am delighted with the prospects of going anywhere. For someone considering a small SUV (I have one also), the GTI has almost the same utility, and is light years more fun to drive. Highly recommended, especially the 2015 MK VII vehicle, which is garnering raves from the press all over the globe. ","Having owned probably 50 vehicles in my life, and with a new teen driver in the household, I contemplated all sorts of options, but then thought, ""What's the one vehicle I've ever owned that I wished I had again."" My original MK I GTI. And to say I'm delighted is an understatement. Incredible mix of utility (hauls anything); practicality (MPG in mid 30s); and fun. The thing is just a hoot to drive. My Porsche 911 has barely left the garage ever since. Mine is a CPO car with 10k miles and I paid half, HALF, the cost of the average vehicle sold in 2013. For someone who wants a car that can do it all, you would not be disappointed.

The rear seating is suprisingly comfortable and spacious (significantly larger than my 1998 A4 Avant). Fuel economy is better than expected and 32 to 35 mgp on the highway depending on traffic. 
","As others have indicated the Navigation and Stereo in the Autobahn is only okay and not as good as it should be for the price. Additionally unlike Europe the vehicle can only be spec'd as complete packages instead of the customer being able to select the options that they want. Rear and side visibility is relatively poor in this car. The B and C pillar block the side view and the small rear window and rear head rests limit the rear view. VW should have included the rear back up camera that is available in Europe and compatible with the Navigation/Stereo (it is in other US models with this Nav system - ie Passat).

Drove both the SE and SEL models and decided I did not need the fancier seats and higher price of the SEL. The only other difference is a few chrome trim pieces and the rear view camera that the SEL gets. Watch out for the tires! SEL's have Michelins or Hankooks which were very quiet. Drove two SE's, one had Bridgestones which were VERY loud, bought the one that came with Continentals (as good as the SEL's Michelins for quietness). With a near 50/50 split of city/highway driving getting 24.5 MPG with fairly easy driving, can't resist the occasional burst though:) This is a very quick car with virtually no torque steer issues. Interior is very roomy for a car this size. Vehicle does many things very well. Happy with the purchase, oh and maintenance is covered for the first three years as a added bonus ! ","The 3.6 offers excellent acceleration and good fuel economy. Interior room is excellent. Classy good looks inside and out. Quiet, smooth ride. Leatherette seats are comfy and built to last.

As far as value goes, I couldn't beat it. Got an excellent deal on it.My monthly fuel savings covers the car payment. The rear seat is super roomy and the trunk is huge. I test drove many cars. Small 4cyl cars with similar mileage felt cheap and small. Hybrids didn't make sense because of the premium price and the cost to replace the batteries once they need replacing. The TDI Premium offers everything anyone needs in a car. I could get easily 800 miles out of every tank, but I choose to drive normal. This car has plenty of power despite the 140 hp spec. The torque is 240 lbs and that is what matters for normal driving. On the highway 80 mph feels like 40, and you can pass very easy and quickly. For people such as myself who drive more than the average person (i do 35k miles/yr) this car is perfect. It is absolutely awesome to take the car out and not be thinking about the mileage. ","First the mileage. At under 6k miles I'm averaging 42mpg. I expect this to improve after first oil change. The DSG trans is very smooth. Regarding the 40k mile service, it is a fluid change that any DIY'er can do.The stereo is very good and navigation works very well. Car is very quite inside. After much research I decided on the TDI Passat because of mileage, strong engine and also the longevity of diesel engines. Yes I could have gone with a gas car that would get close to the same mileage, but it would be a tin can compared to the Passat. Diesel is more expensive, but most cars are tested with premium fuel to get those extra miles and also most require premium.Overall, excellent car. 
","Not much to dislike. All this is nit-picking. The navigation takes a few seconds to boot up. There is more road noise than I would like. But this is due to the tires that come on the car. The car doesn't come with heated steering wheel and no HID's. I'm really chocked at the lack of HID's because this is a luxury car. But again, this is really nit picking.42 MPG's so far and expecting to get better.

I ran out of charater space in that box. .....The rear window has had this ongoin issue. It has been evaluated and already has had the regulator module replaced once. This was 1 week ago. Guess what's happening again??? Yes, just as the steering wheel electronic issue happened multiple times, this too is happening MULTIPLE TIMES! The car will be going into the shop AGAIN in less than 3 MONTHS. I am VERY displeased and frustrated at this point. I don't trust that the car will hold up ""electronically"" now or in the future. I don't want this particular vehicle anymore and the dealer sales personnel are not helping correct this ""Quality"" issue or make it right. I would consider this car an ""electronic lemon"" at this point. I wouldn't mind buying another Passat TDI, in hopes that it's just this particular vehicle that has the quality issues. .......Very disappointed. ","The vehicle gets outstanding gas mileage, to say the least. The power is good for only 140bhp, but it will get you where you need to be without being disappointed on passing acceleration. I enjoy knowing that the diesel engine is strong and can go many more miles than a gas powered one. The transmission is smooth and quiet to this point. All the little extras are nice as far as interior trim and gadets go. So far, it's the gas mileage that has impressed me most. I am averaging 38-42 mpg/city and 48-51 mpg/hwy. 
","Now here comes the cons. First of all, i have only owned my 2013 TDI/SE Passat for appx. 2 1/2 months. Sor far, it has been in the shop going on its 6TH time!! It has not been for powertrain issues, to this point. All of the issues have been electronic in nature. The issues have been with having to replace the BCM once after a factory remote start was added (out of pocket) at the dealer because the BCM w/o the ""fog light"" option will not work. It will ""FRY"" the BCM of you add this option. Then the steering wheel elctronics have all malfuntioned (to include the Horn). This has happened TWICE already. Then, the rear passenger window will intermitently not stay up after attempting to roll up.

Even though it's not perfect, I absolutely love the car and would recommend it. ","Love this vehicle's style (interior and exterior) and the ride and handling. The TDI is really fun to drive; accelerates smoothly and quickly and feels like it has a much more powerful engine than it has. Has a very large, roomy interior that is very comfortable. I have been calculating actual mpg and it's typically 37-39 mpg in 40% city/ 60% hwy driving; I get about 550 miles until the fuel light comes on. Test drove 6 different mid-size sedans and the 2013 Passat TDI SEL Premium won me over at the first test drive. No car is perfect (including this one), but the combination of style, handling, interior space, performance, TDI fuel efficiency, and price made the choice easy. 
","As has been mentioned in many reviews, the multi-function instrument display for the radio/nav is not great. It is, at times, frustratingly slow. I can stand it most of the time, but it isn't very pleasant when typing in addresses or trying to select channels. Many times it takes hitting the screen ""button"" 2-3 times for it to register. Brakes are extremely sensitive; they do take some getting used to. The computer mpg calculator is extremely inaccurate (see actual calculated mpg above). I have had to bring the car into the dealership once so far; they had to replace a fuse that had blown rendering the 12V outlets inoperable.

The ride quality is good and squarely aimed at the US market in its handling, but not what an owner of a previous German sedan would expect. I enjoy the power and smoothness of the V6 and DSG 6-Speed drive train; I haven't tried the TDI, but there is a fervent fan base; I have tried the 2.5L and glad to hear they are phasing it out. The 2.5L was lacking in ""oomph"" all around and was a bit loud as well. Those looking for a ""Teutonic "" sedan will be underwhelmed at this ""naturalized"" version, but if coming from a US sedan or an Asian make, it may be a good fit. ","Solid all around, build quality is excellent. Very roomy interior and trunk. DSG 6-speed Transmission is very smooth. Paddle shifters were unexpected surprise. MFD display in instrument cluster is very useful and the controls on the steering wheel for moving through the screens is easy to use. Entertainment/Nav system is very nice, and I've found it easy to use, it doesn't have all the ""bells and whistles"" of the competition but works just fine for me. I love to drive this car everyday, it makes my +/- 1 hour commute something I enjoy. 
","Exterior lighting, headlights in particular, have gone backward in technology used. No AWD option; the FWD has been fine in the light snow to date, but coming from AWD in previous car, I'm cautious and pay closer attention to the weather reports. Ride/handling is a little ""soft"" for my liking, a bit more ""roll"" in the corners than I'd prefer. This car was designed/built for the North American market; its far different than its European sibling. If I wanted a North American car then I would buy a GM/Ford/Chrysler, give me back my European refinements!

At 10cents a kilowatt, you get 25miles of driving for about 75cents. With the electric mode plus 46MPG highway, it is really a great car for any driver even when the commute is longer. When I know that I am going to go over 25 miles. I use the electric in town, switch to gas on the highway, and switch back when I exit. All done with the push of a button. I would call it the best hybrid on the market. It is not limited in range like pure electric cars as it has a great gas engine. It does not rely solely on regenerative braking like most hybrids and charges from a standard 110volt outlet in about 7 hours.It will run at highway speeds on electric unlike most hybrids that switch to gas at 25 to 35 mph. With the plug in feature, all electric mode, regenerative braking and high mpg gas engine it is a great all around vehicle. ","My drive to work is about 12 mile round trip, so I rarely buy gas. It costs me about 30cents and takes about 4hours to recharge it each night. I charge it from a standard 110volt outlet in my garage. I did take a 350 mile trip and it averaged 46MPG on gas. I really like the fact that you can drive it solely on electric even on the highway. Most hybrids only run on electric up to a low speed and then switch to gas. Ford did a nice job on sizing the batteries. Since they are only about 25% as heavy as pure electric cars, they provide good performance and fully charge overnight from standard 110VAC. A very nice quiet car for daily commutes on electric plus great highway range when you want it. 
","I do not think I would change anything on the drive train side. The leather interior and multiple bells and whistles are nice, but I would like to see a model with a standard interior and a lower sticker price.

Test drive one if in doubt. Check with your local power company. They installed a 240 charging station on a separate meter with low electrical rates if charging is done at non-peak times. Taking our electrical billing for the plug-in vehicle electricity into account, the Energi definitely is delivering the 100 MPGe on the window sticker.The charge station support plus the plug-in vehicle tax credit are worth considering. ","This is a review of our second Ford C-max Energi. We love these vehicles. Our drive cycle is such that most of our trips are within 25 miles. Therefore, with the plug-in drive range of at least 20-24 miles, we seldom buy fuel. The 20-24 mile range is extended with the regenerative braking system. It is common for us to get through town with extended electrical range with the regenerative braking. When we do go for longer trips, we have averaged in the 40's. In electrical mode, the Energi has plenty of guts to merge into traffic and accelerate. These vehicles are absolutely fun to drive. We enjoy the Ford my-touch electronics. The vehicle dynamic controls make the ride enjoyable.

After the minute, you put the car in neutral and turn it off. The C-Max does not track mileage when it is towed. The car is really nice to drive. It rides well and has great acceleration.

Since I do a lot of freeway driving, this should raise the gas milage to closer to the 47 miles that Ford puts in its advertising. Ford does say that the 47 mpg is the goverment test that should only be used to compare one vehicle to another and not what everyone should expect. There has been some comments about the touching breking, but after a few days of driving this vehicle I haven/t noticed this issue at al. I personnally like the size of the vehicle, small but very roomy. My children are grown, so it is perfect for my wife and myself.l ","The car handle very nicely. It has all the getup and go you need when you have to step on the gas, but you don't buy this car to be a drag racer. I have owned this car for 9 months now and it does take some getting used to to get the best gas milage. You don't drive it like a regular gas engine vehicle. I am now getting 42 miles per gallon. I am excited about the new recall I just had performed on the car. It's not a defect recal but raises the top speed the electric engine will run from 62 miles per hour to 85!!! Nothing but the all electric vehicles can do that. The appearance is nice and the quality seems very good. 
","There are a few little things that I would have liked to have like a spit center consol compartment like I have in my Fusion, power fromt passenger seat, a couple of small compartment for items like coin, both of these are in my Fusion. There is a size difference between my wife and myself. She is 5'2"" and I am 5'11"". I find that the steering wheel needs to be closer to me. I can't rest my arms on the door and center consol support comfortably. Also, the driver visor when I swing it to the door window it too high to effectively block the sun and I doesn't extend out again like my Fusion does.

The contin. variable transmission keeps the gasoline engine rpm basically constant at 2000 rpm so the sound is subdued. Of course the secret to really high mileage is to drive so that the engine is off, at least half the time. We got so-so mileage, high 30's, until I watched some youtube videos where car reviewers illustrate the technique of ""pulse and glide"". By the way, our AT&T bluetooth phone works fine with the car. We have an LG 395 phone. No problem. 
","I have to clean my backup camera every now and then to have a good view behind--but the mirrors have very good visibility. Also, as with ALL hybrids, the mileage tends to diminish if I'm driving in really cold weather. I've checked with my Prius friends. We agree, when the temp. is in the 20's, the mileage will slip down to about 35 mph. I think this has to do with increased rolling resistance and the tendency for the gas engine to run longer in order to heat the cabin.

Wife needed a car now and this is the best choice. Being a new model, I'm sure Ford will work out the bugs that will turn a great car into a fastanstic care. It was in the running for Motor Trend's car of the year, and if these issues are solved I think it can be the car of the year next year. Will see how the MPG goes. If this doesn't improve this can be a big issue. ","Have only had it a week, but enjoy driving it. Kids are grown, so with back seat folded down, plenty of room for cargo. Wife's car, I have a Fusion that I love, but I also enjoy driving this. Use it when we drive arount town for the better gas milage. Plenty of HP, SEL seats are more comfortable than my Fusion. Seems much bigger on the inside than it looks. Had the granddaughter in the 40 back seat and had the 60 side down for storage. Visiblity great especially out the front. I looked at the Prius, and C-Max wins, feels and looks better and material seems better quality. Prius does have the track record, but I hope the C-Max holds up as well. I feel I made the right choice. 
","Also not getting the MPG I thought. The car was a demo and had 1,100 miles on it, so it is partially broken in. Filled it up at 1/2 empty for the first time and only got about 35 MPG. Needs more little storage areas in front. My Fusion has plenty. Center console arm rest should have a split storage. Only have one deep one where things get lost on bottom. Would like a better read out that tells you when the gas engine is running. If the blue lit MPH dial turned red that would be perfect. Need to find out about the spear tire, not sure if it has one. Love the backup sensor, but volume seems low and service didn't know if it could be increase. My Fusion is loud.

This is my car. This is my EDGE. ","We just recently purchased a 2013 EDGE SEL with the V6 Engine, plus a few added optional items. I like the innovative technological instrument design and the ergonomic appointments. It's very easy to navigate and setup. It's a well thought-out paneling. The car is very comfortable and 'feels' very solid. The gray leather package is as advertised, the panoramic vista roof is dramatic, handling and braking is very responsive and exact, suspension is 'soft' without sacrificing the 'feel' of the road. My only disappointment is not opting for the electrically controlled hatch opener and the distance sensing cruise control, but oh well, a bit of heaven on earth is a great thing. 
","Frankly, the gas mileage. I realize all things are relative but I just like driving this puppy so much that I probably burn more fuel than I really need to. That's the culprit - the 'want' to drive far outweighs the 'need' to drive. It's also a bit pricey. I wish they made them with a MSRP price around 10 grand so I can buy 3 of them for the price I paid for just one. 0-60 in 7 seconds is a bit sluggish even for a 6-cylinder DOH engine but adding more horses will just blast my monthly gas budget to smithereens.

A shame since we really like the car but not the way they treat their customers. ","We were really pleased then ford decided to upgrade the sync. It was a terrible downgrade. We had paid for a lot of extras in the system and a week after buying the upgrade was done and we lost the things that had been played up to us just a week before. There was no choice in the upgrade and ford would not reinstall what we PAID FOR. The rest of the vehicle we really like. 
","When we got the vehicle home we found glass from the rear window. We inquired about this and was there any other damage. We were told it must have been done at the factory. We also found out later the rear quarter panel had been painted and maybe the left rear door had a scratch repaired. Ford rep had no problem with this since we didn't ask before buying if there was any damage. If you buy ask first about damage. Shame they would let their dealers pull this stuff.

","I looked at CR-Vs and Escapes....but after driving an Edge SEL and seeing how I could get a larger, nicer vehicle with very comparable gas mileage for a few thousand more I didn't want to settle for the smaller car. Appearance is a definite plus. A lot of the smaller crossover SUVs are starting to look more like minivan crossovers. The Edge definitely has a more SUV appearance inside and out. I have seen some negatives about the room in the front but to me it is spacious. Sync is great also! 
","This may be just that it's been a long time since I drove an SUV-style car, but the back window has horrible blind spots. Luckily the SEL that I bought happens to have a back up camera. It was not feature I specifically looked for but the model with everything else I wanted had that too. I am so glad I have it and I think it should really be standard since without it I imagine backing up would be quite difficult. I am learning to back up mostly with the side mirrors and the camera!

I've gotten to where I won't accept certain vehicles as a rental because they are pure junk. The Edge is one of my favorite cars to rent and drive which led me to buying one. I'm very happy with my decision and would highly suggest anyone looking for this type of vehicle give it a look as well. Is it perfect? NO! But then no vehicle is right? It is a much better vehicle overall than it's competitors though. With the way it looks and drives combined with the all of the technology available on it, it seems like the best choice to me. If Ford can just address some of the small issues they would surely put the competition to shame. ","I really like the Edge's looks and the way it drives. It seems to be just the right size and offers features that others in the same class do not. The technology is class leading as well which is another reason I went for the Edge Limited V6 with Sync, My Ford Touch, Nav, & vista roof. I've had very few issues with the Sync and MFT systems once I learned how to use them correctly. Definitely has a learning curve to it. 
","I've been disappointed with the MPG which I've seen others mention as well. I only get about 16.5 around town and about 23 on the highway (driving mostly just above 75 MPH). The only way I think I could get close to the EPA rated 27 MPG on the hwy would be to drive under 60 MPH. But then I would get run over by the other traffic so not really an option. The MFT system definitely has a learning curve to get it to work correctly but I think we all have the same issues with our smartphones don't we? MFT can be slow to respond in comparison to a phone though which is a little annoying. The traffic feature on the nav system also seems outdated when compared to Google Maps on my phone.

Some of the smaller competition doesn't even offer significantly better mileage than the much roomier Edge. The Edge in Limited trim was just as nice as the models I looked at from luxury brands like Lexus and Infiniti. Performance and driving experience were similar enough that I could never rationalize the price difference. We were trading in a 3 series BMW, so comfort and performance were high on our list of criteria and the Edge delivered on both as well as any vehicle in the price class. ","I just recently purchased a used 2011 Edge. I looked at everything in the small and midsize cross over class and decided the Edge offered the best mix of what I was looking for. Competitors that offered more mileage also offered far less cargo space and the Edge offered the room and level of comfort I was looking for with reasonable gas mileage. There are a couple of crossovers I think have better exterior styling, but they are in the luxury segment and cost $10-15k more than a comparable Edge. The interior comfort and driving performance of the Edge Limited were just as good as the luxury model in my opinion (I bought an SEL optioned up to almost a Limited). 
","While I haven't had problems using the touch capacitive controls, I think Ford would be wise forego them and resort to older style knobs, so the choice is new tech touch screen, or old tech knobs, rather than a choice between two new tech options. Knobs would appeal to older drivers and would likely be easier to use on a bumpy road or when the driver might be wearing gloves like in winter. I gave the Edge 9's on trouble free and should others buy, based on previous positive experience with a 2009 Edge we had as a company car. That car never gave any problems, but since I just bought the 2011, I didn't feel I could give it 10's just yet.

Have had no problems and I love it!This is a fun car to drive- handles well and looks sharp. I have the Limited with its many features but no add-on packages. Seat adjusts to my bad back and is so very comfortable. Finally, a car that is designed with every common sense little thing that I've missed for so many years- from adequate 12 volt outlets, to a dash and console design that utilizes every space to my advantage. Mysync is wonderful- I get in and it locks on my phone and takes care of my calls. Great sound system that allows me to bring in music on a SD card or USB. I have never really been in to cars- always drove an old pickup- but I love this machine. Super quick acceleration with its 265 HP DOHC 6. I will buy another. My wife is tired of driving my old truck! ","Sound system and associated player abilities. I pay for the optional ""MySync Services"" (about $5/month) which gives me turnby turn directions, and obviates my use of my smart phone for that purpose. Back seats fold down very easily for a huge storage space. Complete control over so many options on the look and feel- including the information displayed on the dash. Seats are very comfortable with great (finally) lumbar support. Everything is designed with driver comfort and convenience in mind. 
","I am disappointed with the gas mileage (22 city, 27 on highway). My 2007 Ford 500 got 31 MPH on the highway. I know this is in part due to the overly powerfull 265 HP engine, but I would personnally sacrifice a few horsepower for a few more miles.

With two kids in car seats, there is almost always some sort of space issue in the Edge. The gas mileage is good, but you can get better other places. When I purchased, I was comparing the GMC Terrain and Kia Sorrento. Looking back, I wish I would have gone with the Kia first, or the Terrain second, but got a special deal with the Ford at the time that seemed too good to be true. Its not a bad vehicle, but I would have been happier going a different direction. ","I have owned 2011 Ford Edge SE FWD for just about a year now. Overall it is a decent vehicle. The engine is very strong and makes merging onto the freeway a breeze, although your gas mileage suffers greatly when you punch it too often (averaging 23-24mpg mixed hwy and city, then have one day of ""spirited"" driving knocks you all the way back to 19 to 20). The ride is very comfortable and it handles quite well. 
","It has it's quirks. Mainly they have to deal with the stereo and the steering wheel controls. They are glichy and prone to stick occasionally and the knobs for the stereo (volume) do not always adjust the volume when it is turned. Rear seat room is nice, however the middle seat is unconfortable. The break where the 60/40 split occurs is awkward and can cause a sore ""cheek"". At first glance, cargo capacity seems adaquate but because the cargo area is so rounded, it has the ability to carry many small things but nothing of great size (height or width). Lots of torque steer in the front wheel drive version when you punch the throttle (keep your hands on the wheel...).

Plan on keeping it for a long time. As a person in mid-life - I keep looking at my husband and saying:"" Remember when we got excited about cars having radios?"" I am a busy person who now and then forgets to LOOK when backing up. Now with my back-up cam I have no excuses. The clarity of the back up cam at night is amazing. My SEL has some extras on it and for me it is just a killer car. This is my first pearl white vehicle and so far, between the light color and the privacy windows it does a lot to keep the interior cooler ( in Texas ) when it is parked. I also never had the Sirius radio system before and those of you who have it know how great this is ,especially for a road trip. No more scrambling for stations as you go down the road. Plenty of interior space - the foreign cars just can't compare with this. The color reminds me of a glacier. Interior is nicely styled with USB ports for all that need them. Way, way,way beyond a car with a radio? ","This is a new age in vehicles. The SYNC system and back-up camera are amazing. Not having to fool with knobs while you are driving is awesome. Love to show the SYNC system off to my friends. The car is rock solid and comfortable. Drove it 2600 miles over Christmas and we felt like we were sitting in our living room. Has USB ports for all devices. Ran my laptop off of the car's power source. Even up loaded some pictures with my name and phone number to my dashboard. Sound system is killer. Car handles well and is easy on gas for a car this big and heavy. Best MPG I have ever gotten in an SUV. And the rear privacy windows help keep the car cooler and also -people can't see your ""stuff""! 
","A couple of minor glitches with the SYNC - but nothing major. Would like just a touch more padding in the seats. SYNC directions needs more work - but SYNC traffic does appear to work well. Another con - I did nearly run off the road one day messing with the SYNC system ( when the car was NEW) while driving. Old adage - no mater how much fun the SYNC system is - keep your eyes on the Road !

Synchronization with my Blackberry is problematic - to the point where I had to disconnect the battery for the system to reset.

My wife said I should not get another truck when I was looking. I wanted something that I could do some general hauling with, get decent mileage, ride well, sit up higher than the average sedan, and look decent. Overall the Ford Edge meets all of these criteria. Only problem I have had was with the handle to the lumbar support, but the dealer took care of this. The Ford Dealer had a great sale when I purchased, took off about $6,000 from sticker, plus service has been very good.I did not get the power rear lift gate nor the vista view moon roof. Really did not want these and looked for one without them. I have the black metal flake paint and the vehicle looks sharp. Overall very satisfied with my Ford Edge and would recommend to others to take a look at. ","Commuting mileage (56 miles) is running 20-22 mpg, 25-26 on the freeway. Handles well, fairly quiet, overall a good ride. Great leg room front & back (I am 6'3""). Hauled an 8' rolled up rug, a small chest, and 10' piece of gutter inside. Like the fish eye mirrors, helps eliminate the side blind spots on the road. Back up alarm has proven useful too. I like the sound system and purchase SIRIUS to listen to the oldies. I like the Sync system, figured out to speak slowly and don't have many problems. Steering wheel controls are easily used and can adjust volume, selected stations, & switching between the different media's (there are little bumps on every other button) without looking. 
","Dash lights have been mentioned by others, but I only notice it at twilight time of the day. Radio display is fine for me. The electric drivers seat doesn't adjust as much as I would like. Using the tilt function doesn't just tilt the seat, but also moves it forward & backwards. Better tilt would help with pressure on the upper legs, a shorter person may not have this problem. Also expected a better lumbar adjustment. Most vehicles of this caliber have electric and more adjustment to them. Does not come with a cover for the back, have to order at about $125 for a rolled piece of vinyl. Again other cars of this caliber have pull out or better systems and they came with the vehicle

I haven't regretted that decision one day since: the Edge has lived up to all the recommendations I received about it, and based on my initial few months of driving, would not hesitate to refer my friends to buy one. Granted, it's not a luxurious interior finish vehicle like the LaCrosse or Ford's Taurus, but not only does it meet our needs, it's fun to drive -- and looks pretty nice sitting in the driveway or driving down the road as well! ","We purchased our Edge in December, leaving a 2005 LaCrosse behind, after looking at numerous alternatives in both domestic and imports, and haven't regretted the decision. Lots of headroom (and I'm no longer hitting my head getting in and out of the LaCrosse), spacious for hauling both children and adults, and comfortable ride. Acceleration is solid, fit/finish is superb, and frankly, we love the Edge; several of our friends are now looking at the line as well after seeing and riding in ours. And the kids love the accent lighting. 
","As one other reviewer noted, the light stone interior tends to pick up and show dirt and other markings - but that's the risk you run when you choose a light finish! An LCD display on the dash, in lieu of the conventional digital display would have been a nice touch.

I love this vehicle and am very pleased I bought it. It handles like a much smaller sedan and has ample power. It cruises quite nicely at highway speed. The fit and finish are top notch; I especially like the color flakes in the black paint, I only saw one car ever with such a nice paint job and that was a full-on custom hot rod at an auto show. I highly recommend the Ford Edge to anyone looking to buy a crossover. ","I am very impressed with the quality, style and overall performance of the '10 Edge. The Vista roof is a fantastic feature, and attention to details like power liftgate and the Sync system make this by far the nicest vehicle I have owned. 
","Virtually nothing to dislike...I wish the mirrors had a power retract feature as the vehicle is quite wide and squeaks into my garage. The 12v adaptor is not key switched, requiring me to turn off the GPS when I arrive at my destination.

Maybe the sport model this time. Or maybe with ecoboost. But still--the Edge is the only vehicle for me now. Plus--I'm an industrial designer, not for an OEM car company but with consumer products and occasional Hot Rods etc so--I'd like to think I know a thing or two about good design and styling. One of my friends is a designer at Honda in Torrance and his company car is that abysmal-looking Accord Crosstour. (IMO the proportions especially are just...wrong.) All my friends from Art Center point and laugh. He didn't design it but he's working on the new one. My Ford Edge challenges him to do better. ","Styling, big color Nav, SYNC w/ Ipod use thru stereo, 7-color changeable int. lights, giant glass vista roof, and 20"" wheels all best-in-class. At 3 1/2 years and 93,000 miles have had no problems. 17 mpg city and 26 hwy. Its been across the country on 7-9000 mile road trips 3X. Venza, Murano did not compare in features for price. I got a $5500 factory rebates combined in March '09--$4000 off from Ford at the start of the bad economy, $500 college grad rebate, and $1000 in 'conquest cash' because I was driving a non-Ford (Dodge) at the time even tho I didn't trade it in. Paid <$35000 out the door for a vehicle with a $42000 MSRP. After all those miles blue book says its still worth $18k. 
","The voice activation could be more intelligent; Like when you are looking for an address and you say the city name, it should notice and display the adjoining cities within a mile--or the city you're in at the time-with the GPS that sound similar first; only then the ones that are 500 mi away after that etc. for example. The fender flares especially are subject to dings and dents in parking lots from careless or jealous parkers next to you. Perhaps a clear silicon cover piece could be applied over these to prevent this.

","The model I bought has no external temp guage which is a drawback in the Las Vegas heat. The car has very annoying rattles on all but the smoothest roads which appear to come mainly from behind the interior dashboard and thus impossible to reach. Other rattles appear to originate behind interior door panels. Within 6 months of purchasing the new vehicle it sprung a transmission fluid leak which made a nasty mess of the garage floor and driveway. It has also been returned to the dealer for sanitising the air-con system to remove a very unpleasant musty/mildew like odour; the dealer advised not to use the ""Max Air Con"" facility to avoid further smells (good advice in the Mojave Desert heat!!).

There are places in which competition beats the Edge and has some better features (Murano CVT, for example), the Edge succeeds though since it was designed as a whole vehicle experience. The car itself is just pleasing and it would be a mistake to point to any individual aspect of the vehicle as the origin of this sentiment.Other than the Sync with Navigation issues, each of the components integrate well with the others. The more holistic approach to vehicle design at Ford is starting to produce worthwhile gains.The car works for the driver as well as the passengers. In this aspect, many of the competitors failed. So far, no complaints from passengers in the front of back seats and none from this driver.Waiting for the hybrid was tempting, but I will probably replace this one with a hybrid in a couple of years anyway. ","The vehicle is generally comfortable and enjoyable to drive.The navigation is convenient and Sync is fantastic, both were major factors in my decision to buy this vehicle. The acceleration is adequate for the vehicle and the handling is responsive. The interior quality is fine for the price and the layout is attractive with the biege and black interior.The options are good for this price point: memory seating, automatic headlights, heated seats, the backing sensors, puddle lamps, mirror defrosters, and entry keypard are all convenient, the power liftgate is more convenient than I originally expected. The moonroof is wonderful. 
","My only disappointment with the vehicle so far is how poorly the navigation and Sync integrate. Individually, they are fantastic. Sync without navigation is a fantastic option with an attractive price. Adding navigation ups the price by $2,000 and should integrate better with the other systems in the car. It's my only real disappointment.One thing for which one should be mindful might be the braking distance, it's a bit more than most in this class, but I drive it at a relaxed pace so this has been a non-issue. Still, at some point I can see some inattentive driver rear-ending me in one. Rear cargo area is too narrow, the green illumation is still ugly, glovebox is small.

I drive alot on the highway to come to work and to take my son to school and the gas mileage has been great. I never gun it or drive over 60. Very smooth ride. The only negative I have is there is no automatic hatch back lift. It is hard for me to close the hatch back after I load my groceries. Of course I have arthritis severe (RA) It would make my life much easier to have the button on the key to open and close the hatch back trunk. Otherwise this is a great comfortable car , with great acceleration. ","This is a very quiet ride. Very comfortable for my family of 3. We love it. We have always had a Supercrew Ford F-150 and decided to try for better gas mileage and comfort. This car is great. It is fun to drive. I can't say enough about how quiet and comfortable it is. Great pick up ..pretty spunky! Lots of people ask me about it and I have even had people come by my office asking to sit in it. It is a neat looking car. 
","No automatic liftgate which makes it tough on me since I have athiritis RA. It is hard to pull it down to close for me, but my husband says it is easy for him as well as my 11 year old son, I usally have my son close it for me when he is with me. I wish ford would add the automatic lift hatch back to this car. And the color options are not that great. Would have loved to have just a plain white Edge, but settled with Black. Still would like the white, not that off white they offer. The clear coat paint is peeling on the hood in some places and on the left passenger door.

We looked at several options before deciding on this vehicle and at first it was odd to have such a nice car. The Edge handles well on the highway and in the city, the features for us work very well.

Having a choice of a vehicle that sits you up high brings better visibility while driving as well as comfort for those long trips. The Ford Edge brings the car back to reality.

I belive Ford Motor Company must file a suit for these comments in MSN as they would certainly jeopardize product sales. Let me tell you all that NO ONE has ever purchased this vehicle as of yet, Ford is making cars to reach certain inventory level and release them all to dealerships on Nov. 2006, Only Ford executives have been driving this car for reliability, quality, and engineering reviews. Ford Edge is a big hit for Ford with meticulous attention to detail and quality. This car will show that North America CAN COMPETE. Now, let's talk about Honda, did you know that 2007 Accord has a very low transmission quality, how about break pads and rotors that only last you 15000km? After all, those who think Ford Edge is not for them, Don't take a test drive. :) ","Style, Quality, Innovation, Power, Control

It seems to be a gamble, no matter what the nameplate is. We bought a 2005 Ford Freestyle in October 2004. BIG MISTAKE. When the car was being driven at 5 MPH or slower and being turned left, it would stall. After this happened three times and documented by the dealer, they bought the car back from us. We had to fight tooth and nail to do this, but it can be done. We got into a 2005 Explorer and have been happy ever since. It is really a shame that Ford seems to be doing so poorly with quality. If all of the folks on here are reporting accurately about their problems, this is really bad news for the guys at Ford, as they are banking on the Edge to be a sales hit throughout 2007 and beyond. I guess that I will just have to look elsewhere for a similar vehicle, but I have learned NOT TO BUY A NEW VEHICLE AS SOON AS IT HITS THE SHOWROOM FLOOR. Best of luck to all of you new owners. ","Please note that I do not own this vehicle - just some advice from owner of Ford Freestyle that I bought when they FIRST CAME OUT...Love the style and features of the car. 
","I am concerned about some of the problems that I am reading about on this site. This is probably why Ford is in such dire financial straits right now. Very unfortunate.
