1 looked at dodge & ford thought the gm would be a better vehicle for my use but i am left wanting a better truck for what i had to pay for it
1 i've test drove all the trucks out there
1 it has great towing capacity and fuel economy
1 would not buy this i would stick to the ford f-150
1 found exactly the truck i was looking for
1 the 62 liter v8 is a monster
1 buying one on friday after testing and driving all the copetitors this truck excels on test drives
1 this truck is !
1 fit and finnish is unbelievable and this thing is !
1 far from the tinker trucks like !
1 this is americas truck for !
1 i am not impressed
1 we have looked at ford and dodge and they have some really good features
1 the 2013 gmc terrain based upon admittedly short experience has proven to be excellent
1 overall i would reccommend that if one is interested in this vehicle don't even look at the small engine you will waste your money
1 i was looking for something more fuel efficient and stylish than my 2008 trailblazer
1 the terrain is a perfect fit and i average 25mpg
1 i would have to rate it up there with any of the best
1 the only other one i think might be better or perhaps just a bit bigger is the cadilac suv or crossover
1 but being as money doesn't grow on trees here in wisconsin i guess i will just be happy wit
1 i was never a fan of american cars but i did say that if i were to get one it would be a gm
1 i love it - so pretty and not !
1 near luxuryno question
1 really like this vehicle if they could just figure out what is wrong with the collision alert system
1 it really is a beautiful car and rides beautiful
1 i figure that it is a trade offif you want good gas mileage buy a compact or a hybrid
1 if you want something more comfortable but lower gas mileage the terrain fits the bill
1 it reminds me of the classic station-wagon a sadly defunct class of cars that were a good compromise between a sedan and a vandon't expect sports sedan handling or acce
1 i can endure for another yearbut will switch
1 it's a terrific package especially styling and !
1 i'll have to just accept that in this eco-nuts era i'm just not going to get the earth-splitting torque of yesteryear
1 i'm not a huge fan of compromise in anything but the terrain is a convinc
1 probably should have purchased a ford edge
1 this is an exelent vehical for the money
1 get the v6 and you can't go wrong
1 i think this car is the next aztec
1 can't see gas gage because of steering wheel
1 drink holders in front rubber lined hole watch trying to pull it
1 this one looks like a !
1 cannot kick on the power or the performance
1 i love the size and performance of the terrain
1 test drive the other vehicles in this class just so your mind is at ease when you decide to purchase the !
1 didn't drive the hyundai or kia so maybe take a look at those just in case
1 the cr-v was easily the most uncomfortable veh
1 just don't go overboard on the gizmos
1 great ride everything in a small suv with 6 cy for all the power and speeds for california traffic
1 will never recommend to anyone
1 didn't realize gmc had such inferior product
1 this is an exceptional small suv
1 i would to see a litte more hp gmc you did a good job onm this truck and how to use it
1 however i think gmc needs to add the guidelines with the rear back up camera
1 most vehicles have this feature when they have the backup camera for the vehicle
1 i would think this would be an added safety feature of the veh
1 i hope the makers consider correcting the problems i mentioned above
1 too expensive for the product
1 gm missed the boat on this one and the dealership was not aware that this feature not available
1 i would give it a 10
1 test drive this vehicle if you get the chance
1 the denali is a very nice suv to drive
1 it has many nice driving and passenger features and it is powerful
1 with 3 dvd screens to watch a dvd movie front seat screen
1 this is an awesome car
1 that's a smart way of lokoing at the world
1 i just can't justify paying over $500 a month for a car payment doesn't make sense to methe last generation was lacking in several areas this generation is the best version to date
1 the double-wishbone suspension is gone in favor of a traditional macp
1 i think this is the ideal midsize choice
1 the fit and finish is very improved over past models
1 braking is also very good
1 this honda accord is nothing short of !
1 quality simply oozes from every component used in the construction of this american made product
1 do some research on the grades of meta
1 wow-wow-wow the 2014 accord ex-l v6 is incredible
1 the style reminds me of a bmw
1 the car is fire
1 the gas mileage is unbelievable for the amount of horsepower you get
1 overall i would give it a 95 out of 10
1 excellent reliable and technologically advanced transportation
1 and it is considerably less expensive t
1 the honda accord v6 sedan ex-l's or touring edition offers high-end luxury and performance at a great price
1 after looking at all the competition including acura the accord offered the best overall value
1 people know honda's reputation for reliability and it pays wen when it is time to trade cars
1 color selection is decent and its resale is very good
1 wonderful car for the size-just as nice if not nicer than its competitors
1 after looking at its usual competitors i couldn't find another that had the looks handling refinement and value found in the civic
1 this car has improved !
1 purchase the top ex-l trim if possible
1 with honda's reputation for quality and resale value you can't go wrong with the 2013 civic
1 the 2013 is physically more attractive in my opinion
1 car buyers should at least consider this car
1 after all they have the reputation of strong and efficient car
1 the prius gets 50 mpg in city - and comes with all the features of the civic exl except for the backup camera
1 with all you get i think that this honda is the best value no matter how rich or poor you are
1 the redesigned civics for 2013 are probably the best small cars on the market
1 even the base lx model is on par with what other small cars have on mid and upper trim levels
1 i won't do much long distance driving so the difference in fuel cost will be marginal
1 visibility is great all around
1 great car for it's price and a proven platform
1 decent car but not the world leader it has been in the past
1 styling: i love the new styling which resembles the 2013 accord
1 the chrome adds elegance and sophistication
1 it is no longer the cheap looking econobox of the pastengine: 18 liter 4-cylinder with 140hp which means it has to work harder when passing an
1 2013 did major improvements from the 2012 model
1 great car for college students luxury features in a compact car
1 everything you need from a car
1 my review of the honda civic ex-l would be a 97 out of 100
1 this is a great every day car because of the gas efficiency its interior comfort and all the accessories necessary for every day life
1 i am leasing this car and frankly will be glad when my time is up so i can return it
1 the thing that bugs me the most is the highway experience
1 the car goes all over the place at highway speed and needs alot of correction
1 braking & handling are ok the acceleration is slow i can feel the street underneath me as if the car is low to the ground
1 buy it and relax and enjoy a great ride
1 i give it a ten all around
1 it looks modern and had plenty of cool standard features
1 i think it would be a good reliable car but far from the best of its class
1 best compact sedan in it's class
1 the acceleration tonal qualities of the v6 engine suspension handling etc
1 it's impressive looking and fun to drive
1 there isn't much honda could do to improve this vehicle
1 the improved rugged styling for
1 i give it a 9 out of 10
1 great all-around !
1 one the subject of drivers size
1 it's a shame this vehicle is such a secret for the general public
1 wonder why the acura zdx is such a failure price but 
1 too bad they lose
1 cars i've had that are up there: 944 turbo legend coupe q-45 94 corvette
1 overall stylishness and function is not to be found anywhere else
1 the crosstour gives me the combination of both
1 should have power liftgate
1 the blind spots take time to get used to
1 good fit and finish
1 great for golf equipment
1 looking forward to many years with my !
1 do not hesitate on this suv
1 the awd gets around 3mpg less around town than the front wheel
1 if you are looking for value comfort safety reliability resale value and good performance then the honda cr-v deserves a serious look
1 however it is a quality built and reliable reasonable priced vehicle
1 looking forward to getting 250000 outa this one
1 however when one adds trim and options it gets pricey
1 needs side warning lights on mirrors
1 the price was great the gas mileage is better than most
1 great job !
1 i did prefer the pilot but not the 17-18 mpg
1 i am getting 25+ mpg in the cr-v in a blend of stop-and-go and highway driving which is good for an awd vehicle
1 haven't had a chance to really test
1 is not a high end ride but very well equipped
1 construction quality is very good
1 headlights are dangerously terrible
1 good job !
1 in eco mode i'm getting 31 mpg overall
1 9 out of 10
1 honda truly made a vehicle in its own category: it's like a jeep a truck and a van all in one
1 the element is perfect for my active lifestyle
1 i love the design
1 it will last many years as honda's do
1 it has honda engineering
1 they evidently last a long time as well
1 if you take a serious look at the way you drive and you find that your real needs are multi purpose functional and reliabilty then the element should be considered
1 you can add a few creature comforts along the way as most do with their cars
1 a great vehicle for carrying anything from a tv to dogs
1 all in all good car for in town driving
1 the fit is a great car that has many thoughtful design features honda's engineers did a great !
1 it has more personality and is sportier
1 compared to other cars we drove this one sits higher and you feel like you are in a larger car
1 i have to tape up the interior of my car
1 cant afford to repair it too expensive
1 a cover in the truck would be very good
1 fantastic car by great manufacturer
1 mileage and i have proof 36- 45 miles per gallon
1 solid reliable high mpg car
1 this is a wonderful car and if you are in the market for a hybrid commuter car you must test drive it
1 there is more out there than the prius
1 honda quality innovation and ingenuity is there
1 lets face itthis truck doesn't exactly win beauty contests
1 but what it lacks in looks it more than makes up for in personality and quality
1 i wish that honda would update the inside with automatic head lights and more up to date controls on the dash
1 maybe they could work on the mileage too with a differe
1 if you are looking for a truck and you do not need a huge bed look at the ridgeline
1 nice going into the dealership and not having high pressure sales
1 salesman at martin honda  bruce said this is what i have and here is the price
1 also if you're going to trade in your vehicle go on line and check itf
1 there is much more to like than dislike
1 added front & rear honda splashguards prior to delivery
1 keep up maintances and itll be a great truck for years
1 hyundai has changed the game with this machine
1 now it's time for them to change the symbol and grab the youth/midrange age market
1 we are the furture and hyundai can be the leader in this lucrative market
1 so what's it going to be ?
1 the car has beautiful lines and style
1 nice job hyundai
1 you won't regret buying an azera if this is the car you like
1 won't see your self coming and going they are unique and standout
1 the base 450 watt stereo is great and includes subwoofer
1 yes it's around $10k m
1 the car is little more pricey than before but it is still a best buy for the money and compares very favorably with lexus mb and audi for much less $
1 finally a v6 that gets just about 30 mpg
1 blue link is amazing
1 better than lexus 350 by a wide margin
1 great car for the money we were used to spending 60 to $70k for her car
1 this car has more equipment handles better at much lower price tag
1 gets a lot of thumbs up from other drivers
1 always finding nice
1 a pleasure to drive
1 nav heated front & rear seats leather and everything a person could want at a great !
1 i am from detroit and know what a car should be
1 oh by the way consumer reports stick to what you know- dishwashers
1 the azera is full sized stylish car that is quiet smooth ridding and very comfortable; whether it's short trips around town or on an extended road trip
1 hyundai is building solid reliable quality cars
1 many people see it out and about and want to know what it is as the azera is not seen on the road very much
1 handles a little like a sports sedan
1 then again i ain't your normal grandfather
1 almost everything comes standard
1 you would think if you went down to this size car the fuel mileage would have been worth it
1 i would consider now a diesel or a hybrid
1 this review is to counter the ridiculously biased review of dennis in south carolina on 08/04/2012 who sounds like an angry 9 year old child - and has no clue what he is talking about
1 great design  plenty of room inside especially back seat compared to elantra and sonatahigher roofline means better headroom higher sitting off ground means easier to get into/out ofignore the review from the guy who doesn't even own !
1 don't do it until someone shows you that hyundai can reach 500000 miles like my previous 97 civic did and overall hyundai copys honda and toyota and lexus and acura
1 when you unlock a hyundai the unlock chime belongs to toyota
1 it's an automatic hatch with 5 doors
1 it's very well-tailored for the harsh conditions of the russian roads
1 come on hyundai bring this fantastic
1 great car for a great price
1 anyone looking for safe reliable car thats below 14500
1 overall i would say hyundai is fast becoming the auto of choice based on how many i see now and the reviews the company is receiving
1 right now it's a no-brainer
1 overall i'd rate it a 9
1 don't hesitate to drop in on your hyundai dealer
1 these guys have come a long way  and these cars are proof of that
1 i commute mainly on the highway about a 70/30 split between highway and city streets and i average 27 mpg
1 my overall review is do not buy a hyundai or kai
1 you would be better off with some other vehicle
1 i will never ever buy another hyundani or kai
1 your view of this car will vary depending on what type of vehicle you are coming out of
1 you need to take a good test drive of the elantra before making a final decision
1 the mpg is good not great but good
1 i once got 38mpg doing 65mph when doing 70/75mph i get 32-35mpg
1 its about how you drive the car that determines the fuel mileage not what a sheet of paper says
1 we feel as though the mileage for any car will be the same for every person and every environment based on its window sticker at the dealership
1 a lot of car for the money but don't expect great fuel economy
1 only option was the auto rearview mirror with homelink
1 the homelink system comes with a built in compass 3 garage door openers auto dimming at night and hyund
1 i like hyundai as a car company
1 i just rented this car car was brand new only 940 miles on it
1 the industry still has not caught up to hyundai
1 so i felt it necessary to comment on the gas mileage
1 most of my driving is highway at speeds around 70
1 hyundai quality is not anywhere near toyota or honda
1 dont believe the consumer magazines
1 tim b wrote an exellent appraisal of the elantra and i concur with his review
1 folks this is not a luxury vehicle keep this in mind when you are reviewing the car
1 in town gas mileage is not as good as rated
1 last auto 2010 corolla averaged 34 mpg
1 passenger thought i hadn't started car when i went to backup
1 i drove a civic and it was to low to the ground small inside and hard to get in and out of
1 toyota has nothing in this size that is very stylish after all i don't want just good gas mileage i also want a great looking
1 nothing wrong with this car
1 the digital readout of mpg fluctuates !
1 it has above average styling fit and finish
1 you will receive a 5 year free roadside assistance and a 10 yr power train warranty for worry
1 i did a great deal of research and test drove the cars on my short list
1 better visibility in another car would not compensate
1 some good &some bad things = only a fair car i hope this trend of cheaper materials & higherr prices ends soon
1 i would like to see a lit
1 the elantra is a near unbeatable car
1 it is still nice to drive
1 it is nice to drive not exciting to drive
1 get this car you won't be disappointed
1 you hear things like the vents are to low wrong i've had to use the air on it this summer and it hits me just right
1 gas mileage is great so far
1 unless hyundai starts producing horrible cars i will probably buy a new one in about 5 years
1 in order to get great mileage as advertised you can't have a heavy foot during excelleration
1 definitely would recommend it as a commuter
1 other that the mpg this car is great
1 hyundai seems to understand that good customer service is what sells cars and keeps customers coming back
1 i have a whole new view of hyundai automotive engineering capability
1 these guys are off the charts where it !
1 form and function are very well executed with the elantra
1 ipod integration is wonderful
1 car rides nice  ok on gas and good looking car 
1 handles well also
1 love the heated seats
1 the car was towed to the dealer and was told by local dealer and the manufacture that
1 gas mileage is not what is stated or even close
1 seat seam uncomfortable shifter is clumsy could have put leds in mirror and door lock switches
1 great value compared to other vehicles in this class
1 car is stylish and even fully loaded isn't overly pricey
1 a little more truth on the gas mileage claims
1 looking for a reliable vehicle 
1 look no more
1 i am beginning to think the auto trans
1 i comparison shopped the honda civic i have owned four the scion nissan mazda ford focus and fiesta toyota corolla chevy cobalt and dodge dart
1 hyundai needs to work on a permanent solution to cosmetics with regard to the finish of the paint and
1 no get up and go
1 get the gls with preferred package and you're set
1 hyundai has lost my trust and therefore i will not be purchasing any of their future vehicles
1 nice feature i've had in past cars
1 i can see myself driving elantras as long as they are being manufactured
1 reviews don't lie and a fact is a fact
1 if you want to spent more money on a car it doen't make that car better
1 they must be serious led foots
1 i had a kia forte koup which i liked alot
1 the elantra is better then the kia and offers better ride better engine and better transmission
1 again do not listen to the mpg knuckleheads
1 they obviously do not know how to drive efficiently
1 on a recent highway trip i was up to 42 mpg
1 nice carif you want to save money on gas
1 for designer n future lovers the best carnot for driving lovers
1 the fit & finish are very impressive for a car in this price range
1 since this is a new addition to the elantra line there's not a whole lot of info about this specific model as yet
1 the elantra sedan has a lot
1 this vehicle is outstanding in every way
1 i am a hyundai service advisor so i listen to my customers who have all told me what a great car this is
1 overall i would give the car a 99 out of 10
1 buy this car you will love it
1 want a great car that offers awesome standard tech features and gets awesome ?
1 it was the only car that really impressed !
1 don't get a neck ache on a long trip
1 the gas mileage is excellent
1 real brain power on display
1 thanks for that !
1 i have not idea why is the best car in 2012
1 tips avoid to driver and not increase the millages
1 everything seem very good about the car i like the good waranty tooi test drove 6 different car before deciding to buy the elantra the 2nd best one for me was mazda 3 but not enough space and the drive was not has smooth
1 the car is cute and fun to drive
1 the fold down rear seats would provide even more space
1 nothing better for the money
1 the backseat is also much roomier than you would think
1 2009test drove honda fit and on the way to kia soul met elantra touringrest of story
1 would definately recommend this auto to anyone who is looking for a smaller utility vehicle with the ability to haul a nice sized load or fits very good and versital for a small family
1 add another gear to the automatic transmission and it will be perfect
1 be careful what you buy and be sure not to buy any cars from rex perry auto plex in texas
1 next car will get much better mileage
1 a fantastic example of solid quality workmanship this is one vehicle i would recomend to a new car buyer 
1 it is surprising that there are not a lot more touring's on the road
1 then again the blame can be explained by sub-par hyundai dealership service and reputation
1 if you go with the other brands your service is almost guaranteed to be nothing short of e
1 dealer was blowing them out the door last month with $3500 off and 0% for 4 years only $1500 more than used

1 i love the car and am planning to drop $15000 into the car over winter
1 car developed a loud high pitched whine that could be heard throughout the cabin that turned out to be coming from the fuel pump

1 still have to give the 13 genesis coupe a high score 99
1 beefy v6 with an impressive sound
1 can't get any !
1 for the price it can't be beat
1 g 37s is the closest but thousands more
1 if you want a fast sports car for really cheap and at this price its unheard of - this is definitely the car
1 i would strongely recommend this car to anyone seeking a competitively priced sports car if you have not driven a hyundai you must test drive one todaywhy pay more ?
1 beautiful vehicle with a fluid design
1 before purchasing a sports car do yourself justice and take a genesis coupe for a test drive to compare productsthe car will sell itself
1 trust me when you hear the loose washers on a bolt sound coming from our cars you wouldn't like it either
1 my 2013 20t premium has a horrible rattle coming from the turbo waste
1 trust me when you hear the loose washers on a bolt sound coming from our cars you wouldn't like it either
1 not sure about the 8 speed
1 2013 gen coupe 20t is one for the ages
1 in a market full of only a handful of sporty coupes the gen coupe manages to be near the top of the mountain
1 at a price point starting around 24 or 25 grand there is bang for your buck value
1 the hyundai track auto coupe has really impressed us from quality to power
1 great vehicle for the money turns heads and with the 38 direct inject 8 speed gt edition it will scoot
1 hyundai has really stepped up their game
1 can't beat the quality
1 excellent sports car and the turbo is beast
1 take it on the road and it just hums at 80
1 i've put 10k miles on it in six months
1 mileage around town has been 23
1 average 60 on the highway you'll get 28 mpg and at 80 it will drop to 25

1 fun to drive and love the way it looks
1 you can't shift the paddle shifters easily when turning the steering wheel makes sense
1 the manual mode of the automatic will not hold a lower gear if you reach 'redline' it shifts automatically
1 a wonderful car for a great price from a company whose goal was to out toyota the toyota build quality
1 they hit a home run with this one
1 strong car for the money with good looks and power under the hood

1 where do i start the interior is very comfortable and big
1 it also has pretty good power to it you step on it and it takes
1 every bit as good as a 5 series bmw and an e series benz
1 a - 10 = wonderful car
1 its a must have if you are in the high performance and creature comfort age grouop
1 i took a chance driving this genesis for the last 2 days
1 it's a business rental and the car was practically newonly has 800 miles on it
1 it's very spacious and the leather interior looks nice
1 the wood trim looks very fake though
1 the perfect car to drive quite ride great mileage 31 mpg highway 278 mixed
1 gives you 90% of what you get from the usual luxury brands but at 70-80% of the cost
1 hyundai made significant improvements in ride and sound deadening along with refinement on the existing amenities
1 they need to learn to take the car out of eco mode and use the manual shift mode
1 i would do it all over again
1 she is a baby i love
1 i drove one for 12 days rental and fell in love
1 very spacious and easy to handle
1 wanted to take her home with me
1 i felt as though i was lucky to have known her
1 she is a true beauty
1 great value for what you pay for and resale is also high
1 check ebay and judge the value yourself
1 test drive this vehicle before buying any other
1 after test driving the cadillac atslexus e350 and the bmw3 it was clear to me that for the moneythe genesis was the no brainer
1 the technology package is well worth the extra expense
1 hyundai has hit the mark w/ turbo sport styling creature comforts performance & finally class leading mpg
1 if this crossover isn't a 10 it's real !
1 great car worth buying
1 overall a nice vehicle but does not offer features that the competition does
1 driving lights have proven to be a huge safety feature and the lack of them will keep me from buying a santa fe
1 follow up later
1 i live in india in india these vehicle lasts like 10 - 15 years with the indian road condition in mind if it is lasting for those many years then i think it can last more than that in usa
1 can say enough about the technology package
1 not having to push the talk button every time i want to requ
1 purchase this vehicle and you will not be disappointed
1 still breaking inonly 600 miles on it
1 overall i am giving the car a very good rating
1 i was looking for value and found much more in this vehicle
1 this is a must test drive if you are out shopping for and suv in this segment
1 wanted to keep my old suv but it was totaled
1 test drove the santa fe first and nothing compared
1 best gps & interface of any car i test drove
1 this is not your grandmother's boring santa fe
1 many people staring and asking what kind of car it is
1 feels and looks luxurious
1 this cuv in my opinion came out ahead of the other ones i drove when looking for a new vehicle
1 test drove about 10 suv's and this was the best choice by !
1 coming from a sedan it's going to take a bit to mold to me
1 on the highway i get about 28 mpg around town
1 what else can you say about ?
1 sanfa fe 24l is a great suv overall its have lots of standard feature and cool blue light bluetooth is easy to use
1 tailgate is easy to close when at full open
1 driving lights and a power liftgate are nice options but they're certainly not a deal breaker for the santa fe
1 tried both models - the 20 turbo is more responsive and quieter than the 24 and well worth a test drive
1 hyundai has done it !
1 thorough review from an empty nester

1 never would have thunk i would find this so idnsipensable
1 a decent start but not yet up to the competition
1 some major short comings in convenience group which compromises up-to-date user friendly traits
1 an excellent choice in the smaller sports utility market
1 seems to have garnered some great reviews and so far i am not disappointed
1 would suggest it to anyone
1 you won't be disappointed
1 buy it drive it love !
1 i think the design team did a good job
1 to have an suv that can flirt with 30 mpg if you are careful is a pleasant surprise
1 hyundai santa fe is a family crossover sporty look very nice design and fun to drive
1 i reviewed mazda honda toyota and ford models before settling on the santa fe none of the other brands could provide the performance/quality/options for the same price
1 i would and have told friends they must drive one
1 then buy one
1 test drive the navigation before you buy this car and make sure you can live with it
1 i would encourage people looking for a nice size sedan with all the bells & whistles to purchase this !
1 after extensive testing/rentals of new cars coming from a very comfortable fully loaded sporty 250+ hp sedan i don't miss iti tested the sonata hybrid and the 20 turbo and didn't find any significant benefits: gas milage in the hybrid is not so go
1 the car has superb stylingride and comfort !
1 no wonder the altima and fusion copied it !
1 this car !
1 the best for !
1 gas mileage is much better than my v6 maxima but the maxima was more fun to drive manual transmission with a sportier ride
1 do not get this car if you think your going to get 35 mpg highway because it's not going to happen not even close
1 compared the malibu fusion and camry and ended up with the sonata se
1 don't buy 20t
1 this car is a very good choice if your buying a new car
1 easy to work on if you do your own maintenance like oil and filter changes
1 i am very impressed with hyundai quality and performance
1 i plan on sticking with hyundai since they have such a variety of styles 16 year old first car to suv's with 3rd row seat
1 i wanted something that would be best on gas and lowest on the monthly payments
1 sonata has good mileage averaging 26 mpg with 50/50 hwy and city
1 if hyundai can fix the road noise issue it will be even more popular
1 this car is a home run
1 if you are in the market you can not go wrong here
1 we're getting 36-37 mpg on road trips or my 69 mile commute
1 i had never driven a hyundai until i test drove this vehicle
1 i was pleasantly surprised and was hooked
1 if you are looking for a stylish reliable vehicle with enough bells and whistles for a not so expense price then take a look at the hyundai sonata
1 most recently i drove nissan's exclusively and they were good cars
1 however after leasing a 2004 santa fe i am now totally sold on hyundai
1 the car is without a doubt the bang for the buck
1 do some test drives and see for yourself

1 we narrowed the choice down to several cars specifically the sonata altima camry optima and acc
1 for the money i think this car is great
1 i really liked the nissan altima but was not impressed with the warranty and price
1 i have a very nice car for a lot less money and a ten year !
1 i have owned a couple dozen over my lifetime from jaguars to kias
1 the sonata is at a crossroads as to where it wants to go from here
1 it has been floating around at near the top of its class for awhile now but when will see the next step ?
1 beautiful color sporty styling my 18 yr old grandson loves it
1 a lot of perks for the money as well as the guarantees
1 i just fell in love with this car and overjoyed 
1 from 1-10 i give it a 2
1 you would be better off buying a kia optima honda accord or even a toyota camry
1 get out there and drive one then buy !
1 definite 9+
1 better gas better power and looks a heck of a lot better
1 the only car i had enjoyed that came close to this car was a 1976 audi fox
1 car is as advertised
1 recommend to those looking for a mid-sized car with alot of positive qualities
1 can't go wrong
1 if you're looking for a great buy for your money look no further
1 it really adds to your piece of mind
1 and it is as advertised

1 i would recommend this car to anyone that is considering a toyota honda or even ford or chevy

1 if your shopping for a car and want good value you have to drive this car
1 this is my 4th different hyundai since 2003 and they just keep getting better
1 i love so many features of this car and don't regret it at al
1 an excellent car value with a stylish look
1 hyundai has really stepped it up and i'm sure we will be seeing many more hyundai's on the road
1 have previously owned camrys but would recommend this carlove it
1 a very good handling car on the highway and on the street
1 and great on gas
1 better gas better power and looks a heck of a lot better
1 i am not sure how many would believe me but i trade in by bmw 328i for this vehicle
1 great deal on any model hyundai at the moment take a peek for !
1 it's probably better suited for a teenager
1 its was close between the sonata and the mazda 6 but the mazda was more with less stuff though it drove a little better it didnt warrent the extra cost and it doesnt even come to the power the sonata
1 for the style and overall comfort you can't go wrong
1 i never thought hyundai would get my vote
1 so we upgraded to the bigger sonata and have not looked back
1 do something about the passenger seats and mirrors lower it some
1 lets see if hyudai will come through on this
1 i had a 2004 sonata for 8 years that i just loved
1 the 2013 i just like
1 with the price of gasoline today a car with lousy gas mileage gets downgraded badly by this problem
1 i have had the car for three weeks and have just under 3000 miles and it has been a joy to drivei drive 50000 miles a year so this car is comfortable for me
1 definitely recommend years ahead of the bland accords and camry's fusions look good but i bet no one gets 47mpg
1 excellent automobile that offers all the bells and whistles for the average person
1 am looking at buying one as a replacement for 17 year old car
1 the car handles well can fend for itself on the interstate
1 don't underestimate this smaller end crossover
1 overall its a good car for someone looking to get the maximum value
1 if there is a better buy in the small suv market i've yet to find it
1 the previous post lamented that once you trick
1 it delivers what they advertise
1 i'm not the constant driver of this car it's the wife's so driving this from time to time is ok with me
1 if it were mine all the time i think i would have returned it  i really hate spongy breaks
1 don't waste your time researching this car
1 i also like the gauge cluster and dash look better on the tucson
1 if you are considering a crossover suv the tuscon fits the style comfort and afforadability for today's families
1 almost as good as my 10 year old jetta
1 i love pretty much love all aspects of the vehicle so far
1 i know some people think the price for the extra options seems like a l
1 unique styling that wasn't intended to be a family sedan or sports car
1 this has made me a sold hyundai customer i'm sure my next car will
1 did alot of shopping and checked out all brands acura bmw toyota lexus vw audi subaru chevy  ford 
1 when i asked why i should buy there car instead of a hyundai just about everyone of them said hyundai sold a good warranty

1 excellent value low cost of ownership great resale best warranty why would you want something else if you're a value shopper like me
1 and that is the true test of a great car
1 i researched probably every car on the market
1 couldn't find any other car that was sporty took regular gas relatively fast with the turbo has great gas
1 this is a zippy looking car that is fuel efficient fun to drive
1 more power is available in the turbo version but for evey day driving this car is hard to beat
1 it has better safety features than many other small cars and i actually feel safer in this
1 i have to say that hyundai has a great warranty
1 i was also impressed to find out that they are going to reimburse me about $25 for every 3000 miles because their estimated miles per gallon was off by a few gal
1 people still are impressed with its looks and love the 3rd door
1 i will own this car for many years to comehope to drive it way over the 100000 i put on my previous !

1 best car on the market
1 awesome little sporty car !
1 the veloster turbo is head turner regardless of what color you get it in
1 the turbo model has definitely boosted the rep of hyundai upstart
1 overall this new model within a few years will be leading the !
1 but there is a 6 mpg difference in fuel econ
1 i wish i had waited for the turbo for a little bit better acceleration but overall you will not be disappointed in this car just no racing away from red lights

1 besides the sluggish engine the car overall is an amazing product
1 the veracruz is worth considering if you are looking at the lexus rx350
1 resale value probably isn't so great due to lack of demand
1 too expensive
1 excellent ride combined with a ton of luxury features
1 so many standard features compared to it's competitors
1 if you haven't driven one it is worth your time
1 realiability and appearance the car is perfect
1 over all is a very good car and good pricing compare to other similar cars

1 i'm in love with !
1 i like a car to be a little less than common place
1 there are so many bmw's on the road that i shy away from them
1 in pretty much every category that matters the infiniti g is the equal of a 3 series
1 0-60 time handling comfort are all on a par with th
1 the g37x is a bmw killer for much less money
1 great price for an entry level luxury sedan
1 previous vehicle was an 2009 acura tl and this g37 misses some of the attention to detail stuff
1 this is a great 4-door sedan
1 i was looking for a 4 door with a heart of a sports car and this is !
1 given the competitors in the class - along with those cars a step below - you can probably get a better value
1 i have no doubt that i will be buying another one in a few years
1 you will not be disappointed if you buy this car
1 fun to drive
1 i have a 2010 g37xs with 30k miles for over 2 years now and would buy a 2013 if this one wasn't such a great car
1 the stearing feel 999% of the 10 year old 5 series
1 a good compromise good value and performance for the money
1 i don't think you can get a nicer faster more equipped car for the money period
1 this is the 5th infiniti in the family and they have all been beautifully made cars
1 the g37x is a bmw killer for much less money
1 the car feels like a sports car when you want to have fun and is smooth and quiet when you are just trying to get home

1 the stearing feel 999% of the 10 year old 5 series
1 a good compromise good value and performance for the money
1 in short it is a great car but highly under-rated
1 for a near luxury vehicle i would choose this vehicle over the audi due to the fact that my previous audis was unreliable with the electrical many in fact issues and very expensive maintenance
1 the m35 s is another great car
1 ok gas mileage in town and excelent mileage on highwayeverthing is top-notch
1 fun drivers car
1 great styling ride and overall package
1 i have a 90 min drive to work each way 63 miles of rush hour and this car makes it as painless as possible
1 superbly illumintanig data here !
1 it's uncomfortable if you lean back to take a nap as a passenger
1 the seats were initially a little hard during a long trip
1 overall i truly miss my old qx56
1 it was simpler and i don't think that any of the interior changes were for the better
1 this suv instills great confidence in it's ride performance and roadworthiness while at the same time offering comfort for the passengers
1 i hope i am eventually able to figure out the touch screen without having an accident
1 i think it is beautiful and it is supposed to get better gas mileage than the g37x
1 the performance would be better than the g37 were it not for the run flats
1 infiniti is not the japanese bmw anymore with this offering
1 exceptional fit finish and tight handling
1 the most important thing in infiniti cars are that nissan don't install that piece of junk cvt transmissions which kills all the beauty engine performance i love infiniti and i always will
1 the car is just an overall exhilarating machine and a pleasure to drive around
1 having owned infiniti vehicles in the past the q50 is nothing like anything they have built !
1 it's very fast and satisfying everytime i drove itin term of performance pricing and option there is just not a car that can compete with it currentlyi highly recommend you go test drive one if you haven't
1 infiniti has really hit a home run with the q50
1 based on looks alone this is a super car
1 i like the es350 better better ride and better navagation center 
1 this clears the navigation system and resets all the controls
1 overall i give the q50 a 10 !
1 its combination of luxury & performance is a step  or two above others in its class !
1 i found the second generation sedan and coupe somewhat akward lookin
1 the q50 is a great car to have
1 very refied in look and feel of all the materials inside the cabin
1 the outside look is stylish and sporty looking

1 owned a porsche cayman s modified to increase horsepower and 650i bmw convertible this car his head and shoulders above them
1 was looking to purchase a 911 turbo but the f-type is such a head turner
1 my only concern will be its reliability due to jagu
1 it is a small car overall but that adds to its nimbleness
1 the fit and finish is the best and the quality of materials is impressive
1 the new generation jaguar's are truly at the top of the class
1 the dealer rusnak of pasadena use a come-on to get me in then lied about the pay-off price first tying to slip $6000 yes $600000 in additional costs
1 2013 jaguar xf is a fine piece of machinery
1 xf supercharged has one goal in mind

1 its an amazing car to drive
1 on a scale of 1-10 i give the jaguar xf 10
1 if you're reading this you're likely shopping for a high-end car
1 do yourself a favor and check out the jaguar xjl - this car sets the standard for luxury cars imho
1 i've also heard a few reviewers complain that the park assist screen stays on after you go from reverse to drive
1 a pure delight thus far
1 what a car should drive and look like
1 awesome addition to the jeep lineup
1 excellent safe beautiful suv
1 this is a well equipped safe suv
1 it is has a flexible cargo area and the back seats will fold completely flat
1 the back seats move forward and backward to allow tall passengers to have leg
1 we have the upgraded center console and most of the latest gadgets
1 gas mileage is pretty good for 4x4
1 a lot of value for the money
1 the cherokee is alot of suv for the money
1 if you are thinking about purchasing a mid-size suv this one is well worth the investment
1 it handled them all amazingly
1 it is better looking in person
1 photographs don't do it justice
1 he really catered to my needs
1 when i finally do decide to buy i will fly down to la just to buy from him
1 jeep outdid theirselves with this one
1 go and test drive one !
1 you will not be !
1 i'm in the market for a compact suv in the near future and this one is the clear leader
1 for suburbanites like me the limited will be just right
1 the mazda cx-5 is nice so is the ford escape
1 clearly best ride in the class
1 doesn't have the power of my grand cherokee with the v8 hemi but then i didn't expect it to and it sure gets better gas mileage
1 i looked at chevy nissan
1 being brand-loyal to chrysler products and with the price offered it was an easy choice to make
1 i seriously considered and researched competitors but did not find the higher prices for the competitors justified with respect to potential increased perf
1 good basic vehicle for northern climate
1 that cut down on having to adjust to a new car much less engine noise and it has the feel of a passinger car
1 it is among the best of the best
1 also if they were not ongoing i would fill better giving the vehicle a high rating
1 decent ride and capable jeep
1 but even for 55k it is still a jeep
1 tens of thousands cheaper than range rover with the same options but will be in the shop as much as a range rover
1 however with the range rover you will at least have service reps pretend
1 the grand cherokee is an excellent choice we were considering several vehicles in the same segment when we decided to go with the grand cherokee and i wouldn't have it any other way
1 advise- read the manuals and know your build !
1 4k on it so far and i still really like the looks of the gcthe 8 speed tranny is nice except at low acceleration it's a little lungy getting from 1st to 4th gearit tows my atv's with ease with the 57l hemi; although that comes at a price at the pump
1 wish leather and power seats were available on laredo 4x4
1 very unique towing capacity without going to a pick up truck and sacrificing sporty performance
1 first vehicle i've come across that fits this profile
1 the new electrontics far more than any other grand 
1 dealerships with employees that know nothing about the vehicles they are supposed to be doing service on
1 repeatedly blown off and treated like i was crazy
1 overall it is a great vehicle and i am a jeep lover so we will get along well
1 a dealer should be more informed on how to help a comsumer not familiar with a very nice equipment
1 mostly what i notice is the somewhat smaller interior
1 other than that i really like this jeep
1 i would also say it is much quieter than my 2004 gc was
1 i like this vehicle's ride comfort size and drivability
1 time has only improved this ability
1 its got more of a truck feel than alot of other suvs and a bit of a higher stance
1 after owning a 2002 dodge durango for 10 years i wanted an suv that i would love to drive as much as the durango
1 looked for 'american' !
1 if you like a more car like ride on the road this is not the vehicle for you
1 sorry they're not making them anymore
1 guess i'll look at the new cherokee next
1 put a good set of tires on it and you're ready to !
1 i drove it about 10 times and i just don't like it
1 i rented one of these for a week in hawaii and i wanted to share my experienceall vehicles are tradeoffs - you trade weight for space or gas mileage for performance
1 however this seems to be a vehicle with all downsides while offering no benefits in
1 drive before you buy
1 i like the fact it's built in ohio with a great deal of domestic content and american labor
1 after reading auto magazines reviews i almost did not consider test driving this vehicle
1 i gave it a test drive and i could not believe i was in the same vehicl
1 heated leather seats navigation satellite
1 it is priced right
1 great cheap suv on the budget with great gas mileage
1 pricing very affordable
1 would give a 10 out of !
1 i wanted a manual transmission and toyota doesn't offer one in the rav4
1 if you want fancy them this might not be for you
1 colors are limited but good
1 not a van and not a car but a very good choice for something in between
1 if toyota doesn't get real and deal a little better on the rave4 they wanted $6k more for a base model with auto trans compared to the jeep i will be buying anothe
1 i actually drove 8 hours in poor weather conditions to pick up my 2011jeep patriot
1 perfect vehicle for the average suburban or country driver
1 very capable of taking on unexpected road conditions
1 other than the very dangerous ignition problem a good vehicle
1 this vehicle is very affordable
1 it is a jeep it is well optioned roomy and gets good gas mileage
1 my next car won't be a jeep
1 it is the most vehicle for the money if you need all wheel drive
1 not worth it
1 the 4wd in jeep's are in a category by themselves
1 no other vehicle can do it better
1 i have even learned to do the jeep !
1 to summ it all up
1 aggressively styled luxuriously appointed appropriately powered and generously priced
1 there really is no competition to this cadenza it has set the benchmark for affordable luxury for the working class
1 2014 kia cadenza has entered the scene and is starting to build its reputation with a bang
1 having captured a first and second place victory in recent comparison test versus the competition this new kia is on its way
1 exterior of new cadenza will remind
1 great car for the money- and i drove at all of the competition
1 none could compare
1 test drove one of these while i was waiting for my parents maxima to be serviced
1 it needs work badly
1 its horribly underpowered the transmission is indecisive and very slow to shift
1 it will not downshift unless you put the pedal to the floor
1 gm it's time to wake up and smell the coffee
1 comfort quite and overall a will made car

1 the cadenza fits the bill
1 the cadenza fits the bill
1 if you test this car you will buy it
1 it is worth taking a test drive to experience a car that is a better value with all of the features it offers than the competition
1 luxury at a managable price with all the luxo items u would find in a higher priced car
1 i highly recommend this car for at least a test drive it will sell itself
1 good value with the best warranty on the msrket
1 this car handles very well
1 gas mileage is awesome
1 the outside body design is sharp distinctive styling particularly its tail lampsrunning lights and hid headlights
1 this is a nice car however you might want to look for something more economical if most of your driving is in the city
1 between the sorrento the soul and this forte i have become a real kia fan
1 this 2014 kia forte ex is one of the best cars i test drove and you get your moneys !
1 love th select shift 6 speed trans/wich is standard
1 over all this is a remarkably good looking car with more than moderate performance for the money
1 any improvements would cost an additional 10 to 15 g the driving feel of the car and the fit and finish make it a winnerplus it has a five year 100000 k
1 when i was shopping for a car i looked at the kia rio due to it being very stylish and cheap but what turned me off to it was that it doesn't even a spare !
1 it comes with a fix-a-flat can which is only useful in certain situations
1 that's a smart asnewr to a difficult question
1 you'll have more money to spend for !
1 i average 40-41 mgg
1 decent car not going to win any races but still a good solid car
1 is it a luxury ?
1 nope but it has a lot of tech those vehicles have
1 i also get about 375 miles to the gal
1 it's inexpensive relatively fuel efficient and spacious for a compact car
1 this is a 2012 5 door 500 miles on it
1 call it a long test drive
1 wanted a get around town carthat was reliable and low cost in purchase price and came with long term reliability and warranty
1 i compared the chevy spark the ford focus they came in second and the chysler 200
1 rio won most bang for the buck review
1 a worth buying little car
1 see my review of 2009 kia rio5 before considering purchasing 2011
1 go drive a toyota sienna and a honda odyssey
1 it could be a little more modern looking it looks kind of a senior citezens van
1 lots of seating easy to get in and out of and lots of storage
1 great handling and cornering the sedona handles more l
1 drive it  you will love it
1 buy one !
1 it is like driving a sports carvery fun to drive
1 my last favorite was a 1987 colt vista
1 a test drive is not good enough to write a review about any vehicle owning it is
1 have fun with it do the land rover off road events wnjoy the looks
1 for the deals you can get on an lr2 it not only undercuts the x3 q5 glk and xc60 by thousands but even beats a loaded tiguan escape etc
1 riding on a lighter aluminum platform and dropping the base v8 in favor of a supercharged v6 the new range rover sport is certainly sportieri saw it in land rover north dade and now i must buy it till has good !
1 if you don't have the new range rover get one now
1 great for 1-2 person commute
1 this vehicle is not worth the risk
1 manufacturer does not support their product
1 land rover took a big risk in america on this compact suv they needed a better fuel economy asset vehicle to stay competitive and relevant in the market place
1 they created a beautiful car with sleek lines that is 95% true to the prototype we saw a few
1 looking forward to a long trip this fall
1 this suv rides like a dream on the road great power and acceleration
1 i recommend test driving the sport model but if you are looking for more of a soft ride vehicle try the range rover hse non sport model
1 this is also a great vehicle also
1 yes this car is more expensive
1 we prices a loaded prius leather nav moonroof etc
1 if you don't want an option-loaded car the prius or the ci
1 the fuel economy for the ct is absolutely terrific the car looks good and it handles decently
1 but the rear visibility is perfectly awful
1 i am very puzzled as to why ot
1 seriously test drive this car
1 get !
1 you will love it
1 even more so if it had more power
1 this car fits my needs and likes regardless of its tight back seat
1 will be going back in 2 days to try and make a deal
1 a best buy by any measurement
1 it is a nice option if you would not want a prius
1 however you must keep in mind the motor and electric motor is exactly the same of a prius
1 if you don't consider this car you are making a big mistake
1 the car is well-appointed with many of the features you find in a similarly priced luxury vehicle
1 the single most important feature in this car is the sport mode
1 it would be hard to merge into highway with 4 cylinder 156 hp limousine size car
1 sport mode is a must to merge into highway from a low speed
1 for 46k plus price of this car is not worth it
1 great appointments inside the cabin
1 i love the way it looks on the street
1 roomy front and back
1 excellent quality great luxury good performance and outstanding mileage for a car of this size
1 if you like a quiet comfortable ride with some sportiness this is the car for you
1 if you're looking for comfort and quality for the money this is definitely the car for you
1 although the avalon and es 350 share numerous systems the overall driving experience in the es 350 is well worth the extra $3k to $4k
1 premium required in most luxury cars
1 i never thought they could improve on the ones i owned previously but they sure did
1 i can't imagine a better car than this at any price
1 please before bashing lexus for just being and upscale toyota go drive one objectively
1 if creature comfort long term reliability and family are your focus this will be your top 3 consideration
1 yes i have driven
1 just a very nice sedan
1 will be getting eth car in 2-3 days and very excited

1 it's lifted the level of debate
1 this won't be the last one that you !
1 quality construction makes this auto a real winner
1 ride is not harsh like other sport sedans
1 acceleration is brisk with a little engine sound thrown in
1 for a person that loves an excellent vehicle with performance & handling !
1 overpriced compared to other 4 door luxury sedans especially those made in the us
1 in the less than 100k bracket this lexus 350 is an all around practical but cool car
1 i want to love it but the problems i've had with the luxury features are very !
1 i was loaned a porsche panamera for a week and loved it in many ways the gs f sport is comparable with more room in the rear seats
1 there are way too many operating deficiencies to suggest someone lease or purchase this car
1 no hard drive for music as it must all go through an iphone
1 it is very well appointed
1 i am actually looking forward to my next lexus
1 a gx460 will soon be added to our family
1 the clown that gave this car two low reviews should be removed from the review listing
1 it looks similar to the new 2013 altima
1 however you drive the fierce front end of the f-sport effectively combines class with intimidation
1 not worth the money
1 a 5 star ride
1 don't listen to the fake reviews on here marking this car down
1 don't base your decision on my review
1 take each side of the story head down to the dealership and base your decision on someone you trust yourself
1 all you have to do is drive one
1 i would pass on this toyota
1 if i want a great car i'd buy the new cadillac this car is just wrong the styling looks like something from the 80's
1 if i want a great car i'd buy the new cadillac this car is just wrong the styling looks like something from the 80's
1 get !
1 i cannot believe they are not flying off the shelf
1 first class all the way
1 overall very impressed with the new gs
1 great car with new sport handling with all the great qualities of lexus
1 a luxurious ride that makes a driver/passenger feel safe with the solidity of its exquisite engineering
1 outclassed by many of it's less expensive luxury competitors
1 wood sound drive looks = guality
1 this vehicle is almost perfect
1 i dont recomend this car to people who likes good things
1 during this week i have averaged 285 mpg
1 overall i love the car it's every bit a lexus with a kick of sport
1 i think it looks great and is fun to drive
1 i can see why they say it is better then the bmw 335
1 i test drove the new bmw 3 series and mercedes c class but liked the lexus much more
1 just be sure to get t
1 makes the drive in the inner city rush hour a whole lot easier to deal with
1 instead i would spend the extra money and go for the is 350
1 not worth the money far nicer cars out there for this money
1 excellent choice for drivers wanting a great handling car and a reputation for quality and reliability
1 just saw online
1 overall its reliable fast stylish and comfy but it a little to expsensive
1 its a bit pricey but hopefully the price lowers a bit so this great car can be driven by more consumers
1 this car is a patheitc attempt by lexus to make a super car
1 this is a performance car you buy for style and the quality
1 just don't get into any drag races with the new skyline gtr
1 overall if you want luxury this is still the best value
1 i couldnt decide btw ls vs 7 series
1 the body style interior comfort technology enhancements and responsiveness leave little room for improvement
1 pricey but nice
1 be carefull what dealer you buy from 
1 you will like passing the disabled bmws along side the road
1 great saftey features
1 its beautiful car with a beautiful eco friendly engine
1 if you get this car you won't regret it
1 rugged as a tank but super luxe this is the perfect vehicle
1 classic beauty without screaming look at me 
1 airbag and safety features throughout
1 when you slam the door you know by the sound that it's
1 newer suv's from mercedes or range rover may have a more updated chassis and power train but this thing is proven and well executed
1 nothing to write home about it
1 buy a nissan
1 the lexus reputation is what you are buying here
1 toyota corporation has spent billions building up the lexus brand in the past 20 years and it's time to reap those rewards
1 the car is a couple of steps above your toyota/honda/nissan and slightly ahead o
1 buy one you will love !
1 the styling is perfect to me
1 i like the enform system with the computer apps
1 great car for a small !
1 recommend to test this if you are in the market for a luxury suv/crossover
1 would buy a ford explorer
1 lexus quality and reliability
1 the 2013 rx 350 is a great car
1 does not offer a separate backseat temperature control
1 not worth the price
1 if not overzealous with options price is relatively reasonable vs competition
1 overall the product is declining every year
1 turn in our rx in this year and we are looking to switch to somthing beside a lexus
1 for a smaller suv you have luxury style with a nice ride
1 unlike a lot of suv's the rx also has reasonable gas mileage rating
1 best luxury car for the money
1 we tested six suvs in this size/price range and found a lot to like -- and some to dislike -- about each
1 nothing profound there
1 mercedes felt solid but was too small
1 cadillac had power but the cabin felt cheap and plastic-y
1 i am only writing this because i just read so many reviews about how smooth it is
1 it's not bad but definitely not a passenger car or like 2009 rx
1 put a moon roof on it and you will have a lot more buyers me included
1 good looking  but ! price for status !
1 nice suv but american quality is catching up lexus
1 excellent suv gas mileage from 28-30 quality !
1 this is the queen of luxury suvs if you like the styling and lexus craftsmanship you should test out this car if you are in the market for a luxury suv
1 excellent vehicle extremely well appointed
1 i think this is a great car if you're in the market for a big hauler
1 i know it isn't for everyone but i also think it is way underrated and in the large crossover segment of the market for sheer fun to drive as well as luxury and features is has bee
1 if you want refined comfort and safety i would recommend the mkt
1 you will enjoy a quite smooth ride in refined comf
1 this car puts lexus and others to shame especially considering the really poor recent lexus crash tests from the insurance institute
1 the unmistakable unique style performance and interior comfort make it an all around winner in this segment
1 not worth the price 
1 luv the car x milage
1 the top of the !
1 drove similar cars and absolutely fell in love with the mkt
1 i don't work for ford or am i in the car business
1 i do own not lease a number of new cars and typical buy a new car or two every year
1 hopefully the high rating
1 best car !
1 everyone has a cadilacthis is a lincoln baby
1 lincoln really did their homework on this new mks
1 the car rivals all of the luxury vehicles i've seen and tested
1 in value for money it stands apart
1 it's sporty when you want it to be has an amazing ride
1 strictly class comfort and the road is yoursa smile
1 i don't pay any attention to what consumer reports says about cars
1 they're very biased in favor of certain asian makes even when they're not the best
1 this car is a true luxury car and is very safe
1 everyone should give this new lincoln a try lots of standard equipment for the money american luxury is back
1 i've given it all tens
1 love the car really sporty
1 i absolutely love the mks after driving cadillacs for 25 years
1 it will be hard to find a better car for price
1 many people are saying they like the car
1 lincolnford are making excellent cars
1 i am so surprised that their ratings by a so-called experts are not higher
1 it handles as though it is on a rail there is literally no body roll when cornering it stops sure and straight
1 test drive other cars
1 my last rental was an impala ltz ironically i liked it better
1 the car is back for the third time in a year f
1 top notchtest drove the rxmdx and grand cherokeenothing !
1 many of the problems were created by ford/lincoln with the touch system
1 it had way to many bugs in it when they released it and did not have a good patch
1 it has everything you need for a great driving vehicle
1 the mkx has plenty of power under the hood
1 lincoln has outdone itself
1 the salesman did a good job of going over all of the options but it's a lot to remember
1 all the comforts that a vehicle should have beutiful interior gorguos leather seat's and trim exquisitly done with perfection
1 more features come standard with this vehicle than most
1 test drove buick enclave and the cadillac crossover and this car beat both cars
1 i am seing a lot of them out on the roads these days
1 overall the lincoln mkx is a true american luxury car that looks more expensive then it is
1 highly recommend the mkx to anyone looking for a true luxury car with out the luxury price
1 when i use siri the whole sync system has to reboot
1 i hope they fix that issue soon
1 probably the best on the market today
1 again it is a lincoln
1 it is an american company
1 i have test driven every hybrid including the new lexus es and mkz wins hand down for comfort ride styling and mpg
1 the mpg is spot on
1 i'm averaging 42 combined
1 there is no hesitation when in ev mode at
1 last ditched attempt at a failing car company
1 truly your fathers luxury vehicle
1 beautiful car from design to execution
1 the paint is a mile deep ingot silver and the leather on the seats is buttery soft
1 the handling is excellent and the power from the 20 ecoboast is more than enough for any situation
1 the overall concept of the design from head to toe was risky but well worth the return
1 starting with the powertrain v6 pumping out 300 horses felt strong and agile
1 if you test drive the mkz after test driving other hybrids i think you'll agree
1 most review comparisons that include the lexus 350 mercedes benz 300+ avalon audi 6 bmw 5 series and especailly the 2015 cadillac cts don't include this car
1 ford deserves a lot of credit for bringing this car to market and then refining it and pricing it to be competitive
1 i hope that the significant improvements to the lincoln brand can resurrect it just as buick has done
1 it is much nicer than the bmw cts audi or infinity
1 everyone thinks the car costs 15-20 grand more than it did
1 in my opinion the best hybrid on the market
1 hybridcars website give it the best environmental impacxt on the environment
1 i still need to register it to online to get an automated assessment of its p
1 and very driver friendly
1 it's criminal that there aren't more cars out there like this
1 cannot figure why anybody would choose to have the exact same car at the same price for less gas mileage
1 why isn't everybody driving a lincoln forcing the price down for all of us
1 it does take some time to learn how to efficiently drive and get the most out of your mileage
1 this car is definitely worth putting your review !
1 price for the standard features is unmatched across the luxury market; comparing like vehicles
1 i've wanted a lincoln for some time
1 a few tweaks could be done with regard to storage compartments gas mileage etc
1 ; however i have a 2012 and perhaps all those matters were addressed for 2013
1 previously owned a 2011 fusion which i loved but wanted
1 what ever the mpg on car in show room with few miles is likely the mpg it will agerage
1 maybe replace it with the new
1 overall we not gone buy lincoln mkz until lincoln designers find a full electric engine 32 or greater for this carwe will keep the car for maximum of 15 years and during this period company will have lincoln dealership services and i have no idea you d
1 it is a great all around car for comfort and !

1 yes i want one for a daily driver

1 very forgiving suspension and great stability
1 for the price 93000 you can't beat it
1 experts are comparing this to cars well over twice the price
1 not sure why he wasted his time even putting up a review
1 your thinking mactehs mine - great minds think !
1 if you want a cheap investment by it !
1 would recommend if price was more reasonable and build quality is improved
1 terrible horrible car glad they are out of business
1 far too many people find it affordable
1 find away to lower the price and change bmw looks and it will be a spot on car that every one will be lineing up to buy 
1 want a great awd suv that looks great is powerful and gives you 30+ miles per ?
1 look no further my sister is buying one this weekend
1 a rav4 does not come close to this !
1 the cx-5 with the 25 really does drive like a sports car
1 2013 cx-5 will be less expensive but getting the 25 2014 is well worth the extra cost
1 i don't believe anything else changed between the 2013 and 2014 suvs
1 this is hands down the most affordable and fuel-efficcient suv/crossover that is available on the market
1 mazda is one of the top manufacturers in the biz today
1 in looking at this class of car i was interested in the fuel economy the capability of the engine and the zoom-zoom factor that one expects from mazda
1 this grand touring model with all its features was materially less expensive
1 better than the honda crv better than the toyota rav4 in every aspect
1 the 2014 is the same car with minor upgrades
1 i became interested in the cx5 after extensive internet surfing reading reviews and ultimately traveling over 150 miles to test drive one
1 i drove a 2014 cx5 touring front wheel drive model at a dealership in albuquerque nm
1 lots of bells and whistles nothing outstanding
1 we looked at many compact suvs and the cx5 seemed to be the best option
1 ford escape - too expensive rav 4 - ugly exterior honda crv - poor driving experience vol
1 i think driving should be fun but i need a practical vehicle that can hold some cargo
1 the mazda cx-5 fills the bill for the most part except it could use at least 20 more hp
1 nice looking suv with good gas mileage but they should improve the back seat access by moving back the wheel wells to allow adults to get in and out better
1 great driving car with the best looks in any suv i have seen
1 perfect for what we need
1 with the new 25 liter engine this vehicle feels alive agile and downright sporty
1 the car has issues behind
1 if mazda can solve it it is ok because bugs/flaws are reasonable for a first year model
1 but if mazda could not solve it or does not have the right attitude to solve issues it becomes a real problem
1 they do make fun reliable cars
1 i like the fact that you don't see a lot of these on the road
1 glad i waited for 2014 25 engine
1 big upgrade over the crv this year
1 a very impressive small suv
1 great value and very !
1 great gas mileage
1 this jury is on the same page excellent product for the money
1 will it be okay in the western ?
1 i highly recommend this small cuv
1 i have been averaging just under 30 mph in mixed driving
1 attractive exterior design very good grip and steering
1 an outstanding new addition to the suv market
1 the suv handles very well
1 it drives like a race car making sharp turns easy and effortless
1 going to get my 2014 sky blue in two weeks time can't wait
1 quieter and better handling than others i drove
1 the perfect match for economy and power
1 pickup is good comparable to the v6in the escape
1 mileage is better though not as good as some on here indicate
1 by far the most fun to drive and best looking cuv in its class test drove 8 others
1 unlike some of its competitors the advertised highway mileage is achievable a
1 drive it and you will buy it
1 they too had not initially considered the cx-5 but once they did they were sold
1 it too has become their vehicle of choice
1 close to a perfect small suv
1 the bells and whistles on this vehicle are superb and you won't be disappointed
1 buy one you won't be !
1 this car is definitely worth the !
1 my search for the right vehicle was long
1 i have a 16 year old that is 6'3and 250
1 it's little but has tons of zoom-zoom
1 if you want a 5-passenger suv that offers great looks playful driving manners impressive technology and good value the 2014 mazda cx-5 deserves a test-drive
1 that it boasts class-leading fuel economy of up to 35 mpg feels like icing on an already tast
1 great car great on gas more fun to drive than any other suv i have ever driven
1 if your going for the gt pay the extra for the tech package
1 if you are looking for a small to mid-size cuv then this is the vehicle for you
1 i am buying this car
1 excellent vehicle for the cost concious
1 worthy of a test drive first before you comparison shop
1 overall typical great mazda quality
1 great design and have no maintenance issues !
1 final assessment: we did a lot of research between this vehicle and the gmc and chevy equivalents and based our purchase on the reviews that consumer reports gave this car
1 i was wondering why mazda doesn't ask its owners for feedback on how they like the vehicle
1 the ideas can be incorporated into next year's design
1 first one was a 2008 which was bullet proof
1 this one is even better
1 cx9 grand touring with tech package gps etc oh and the tomtom gps hd radio bluetooth is excellent
1 come on down
1 go ahead buy one 
1 the best overall value in this minuscule category of almost a real car
1 most fun small car that should last and is cheap to buy and run
1 mazda attitude about fixing this car is the worst
1 the will not lend me a loaner car to use while they have my car
1 they tell me i have t
1 they won't give me a ride home if i leave the car with them because i live more than 10 miles from their dealership
1 the will not lend me a loaner car to use while they have my car
1 i wish it had a sunroof and leathers seats
1 this is a fun sporty car
1 it is great on gas and is fun to drive
1 i am used to driving luxury cars
1 the mazda 3 gts
1 compares favorably to any of them and at a dramattcally lower price
1 i did a lot of research online in regards to price including the competition and i found out quickly that mazda's don't carry a lot of mark-ups and !
1 i feel that mazda has but its best foot forward on this car
1 i did not drive the mazda 3 with the less horsepower so i can only say that the 184 hp is more than
1 great car for the price
1 great value as i compared other cars in the segment
1 it has come back and it is on a mission
1 from the smiling grill to the new design language of the mazda brand has definitely turned the 3 into a smooth and attractive option
1 displays are clearly marked and simple not l
1 one web site review satated this is the most outrageously fun vehicle to drive
1 there are not many ways to shape a mini-van box  but i feel the m5 is stylish aerodynamic and i like it
1 the mazda6 is an awesome attractively priced mid-sized car for people who like to drive
1 styling is jag-like interior is almost germanic in functionality and the new skyactiv engine and drivetrain has been delivering 28 mpg in the city consistently
1 2014 mazda 6 really stands out amongst its peers
1 with new designs of the fusion altima and accord the mazda had to bring something out to attract car buyers
1 exterior and interior on the 6 is definitely sharp and it will get your neighbors attention
1 loads of tech available if you want it plenty of standard features for the more value minded
1 mazda has a winner with this one
1 from a single test drive this has jumped almost to the top of my short list of cars to potentially replace my 13 year old acura tl
1 after test-driving the competition from toyota honda nissan ford and kia this is hands down the best midsize sedan on the market right now
1 mpg great styling comfort features and fun to drive all at a reasonable cost were the priority features i was searching for
1 my initial short list was civic accord mazda3 and 6 and the cx-5
1 i dropped civic and 3 w/out even looking thinking why go small when small family is ?
1 so we're down to three cars
1 dropped accord because well they're somewha
1 i really wanted to love this car
1 i wanted to get one as soon as i saw the new design
1 i knew i'd have to give up a v6 but must say the 4 cyl took off quite well
1 drive was great but really felt claustrophobic in the thing
1 darn right especially with a !
1 it's just about perfect for a family sedan
1 you name it we test drove it - the combination of exterior and interior styling size handling and feature content are hard to beat
1 iihs top safetypick zoom-zoom great mpg great looksi guess it is the full package
1 i really think it is an excellent value for the $$
1 i had the car delivered to me being the b
1 do a google
1 lots of technology options for your money and overall a great looking car- that looks drives and feels like a much more expensive unit
1 easily in the top tier of all current mid sized vehicles
1 the only cars that i drove and liked more were the hyundai sonata and honda accord
1 one of the best new cars on the market
1 every detail in the car  starting from the engine  i-loop technology and the sensors to the styling inside and out is very well thought of  and you could easily feel that
1 it handles both surfaces equally well
1 was getting 32 mpg on the highway and now we're getting 32 mpg with the k&n in town
1 handling is crisp and tight
1 steering has a bit more assist than needed compared to previous mazda 6 models but still
1 it's wonderful a lot of people love the color and style 
1 i was in the market for a family car
1 must have driven the dealers mad in my community
1 it came down to this and honda accord
1 i am sad to say i went with honda as this is definitely better looking but the cons became the deal breaker
1 i am in the market for a car and this definitely is in top 3
1 understated luxury that is classy
1 its voluptuous curves cavernous interior and above grade fit and finish lets it stand out in a crowded field of full size sedans
1 the competition from the ford fusion honda accord toyota cam
1 it rides better than the accord/altima with junky cvt
1 one of my top 5 picks to buy
1 excellent car for the money good quality feels solid
1 did i say the gas mileage is ?
1 anybody looking for a mid-sized car would be making a big mistake by not looking at this car
1 it is simply far and away above the camry accord sonata optima altima and fusion
1 it's a great car and i'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new car
1 an excellent looking and fun to drive sedan
1 mazda's redesign of the 6 is simply stunning and the value delivered both in fuel economy and in safety features is really compelling
1 my reommendation is to test drive it
1 once you do you will end up buying it
1 the 25 gas is more than sufficient for any type of driving unless you are like me and
1 the 2014 mazda 6 is the clear choice for those looking for an overall nice vehicle which is fun to drive
1 it has many technological advances with luxury sedan safety features
1 young or old you'll love the new mazda 6
1 best new mazda in !
1 do your self a favor and at least test drive the mazda 6 before you decide to buy any other car
1 for starters it costs less and it gives really good gas mileage for a midsize sedan
1 thanks to mazda for offering fun to drive solid handling cars with tons of value
1 if i just wanted a dd it still would not be the speed3 and as far as performance its useless
1 according to experts out there this car is a race car so not for the beginner
1 this car punches way out of it's price range and should not be sold or loaned to anyone under 25 with out close adult supervision

1 you can't beat it for economy of use
1 doesn't make economic logic as break even is about 12 years of ownershipthen you need to buy a battery that i heard costs over $100000
1 i drove the rav4 cx-5 forester xt this vehicle leaves them all in the dust
1 the mitsu engineers have done a very good job
1 i think consumers should test drive this suv
1 i can see why the evo is legendary 
1 this suv has the same all wheel drive
1 just don't listen to the jornalists who disklike mitsubishi and do not give this suv the cred
1 it was down to the santa fe rogue 2014 or outlander
1 i am both a nissan and a mitsu person
1 but i felt the rogue was too plush for an suv - plus it was priced higher with the 3rd row not being standard
1 the quality and value are miles ahead of the bigger car companies and they back it up with a great warranty
1 the mitsubishi product gives you a great value at an affordable price
1 there is nothing else like it
1 incredible value and performance
1 wow just drive one
1 you don't need my impressions
1 i can't wait until my boxster is built
1 i still remember the test drive
1 it's a 10+ and i would highly recommend this vehicl for anyone looking to enjoy the purity of a true sports carwell done p
1 the visual appearance lines of this car are amazing
1 certain cars jag xk audi 5 look great parked; the redesigned boxster is now in this category
1 performance wise- it rocks; especially the boxster s at the same time you can drive it around town
1 for the price it really should have these two options
1 a great car for those who enjoy driving
1 dynamite styling excellent build quality and all the performance you need for driving within legal limits even with the base version
1 several annoying features need correcting in the next iteration
1 there is no better deal out there
1 coming out of a superduty 4x4 crewcab diesel perhaps i am still comparing the ram to a much bigger heavier truck
1 the ram is a very nice truck
1 i compared this vehicle with the ford f150 and the toyota tundra and there is no doubt the ram is
1 i think for the money it is the best truck out there
1 i was a chevy man for 45 years and now i am a dodge dude for the rest off my !
1 chevy the imports and gmc are not even in the same leagueit's all about ford vs ram nowi hate the low end torque of the ram as bolted to a 6 spdford has that nailedbut i'd put the ram interior against anything anythingi'd put uconnect against any
1 i cannot recommend the truck of the year
1 i dont know how ram got this rating
1 and i also feel the road testers need to go to dealerships and see how they would be cared for as a cust
1 a best buyram trucks are real trucks coil spring rear suspension and hemi engine are hard to beat
1 i would only buy one if i couldn't afford the f-150
1 i still think it is nicer on the exterior than the chevy
1 the interior doesn't even compare to the fords styling
1 in these cases i would go with ford or chevy first just s
1 this is the best
1 if it was priced 70000 it would be well worth that
1 how could any of this be bteetr ?
1 i have no complains i really didnt want to buy a truck in the first place but i got one for its functionality and when i went looking the ram 1500 hemi was the meanest looking truck out there and with the limited slip diff
1 391 gears the eco boost stays
1 they are far ahead of the competition is every aspect
1 you think you are driving a smaller and little truck
1 worth a solid look if you are in the hd truck market
1 i haul a large trailer around with a dozer and tractors and it handles them with ease
1 best heavy duty out therebest fuel mileage out there
1 overall i would still rate the truck at an 8 even with the issues i have had
1 it is a work van
1 there are no other vehicles in this category to compare
1 the ford sprinter is ugly small and made in turkey
1 the rest are too big use too much gas and do not fit in parking structures
1 paint quality is poor and chips easily
1 my father had a trucking company many years and he always had dodge trucks for cargo vans pickups and box trucks found them to be dependable sturdy and long lifespans
1 this is an excellant small truck
1 the 47l gets good mpg on the hiway if you use speed control
1 it has good exceleration but nothing spectacular
1 wind does not seem to affect it greatly
1 it is great for commuting or us
1 bear in mind that the later production big horns were trucks intended for commercial use fleets and so
1 so they are very basic; no luxuries at all and that's why they are cheaper than the average tacoma
1 but for the money they are excellent value
1 veery poor showing
1 a fantastic car adorned with an over the top opulence unsurpassed by any other luxury car in existence fine craftsmanship with every car with every dollar
1 i miss the old styling
1 so much for the british empire
1 buy one and feel the freedom of !
1 definitely last choice in this price range
1 a great car ultra rare as only 557 were made
1 i think there should be more on the road :d
1 and i intend to keep this and my other saab for many more years
1 entry level $40k version has everything you ever thought you needed in a car and nothing you don't
1 ok car for the close-out price of $30k after saab went bankrupt
1 exceptional job !
1 do not listen to the reviewers that have called this a good first caror a good car for a teenager 
1 these people have no idea what they are talking about
1 one of these reviewers wrote one must be not understand can get a real sports car for right un
1 people who criticize this car really need to get a !
1 when you add in the great gas mileage it muliplies the benefits of ownership
1 i think that this is a really great car regardless of the fact that it is so inexpensive
1 this car is a dream to drive and the added gas mileage and reasonable price only add to the experience
1 this is a fun ride that you aren't afraid to drive
1 great fun car to drive
1 good job !
1 what is not to ?
1 i have not seen another one yet so it is still unique
1 i ? wait for the aftermarket parts to stat becoming available
1 its a little too late to bring this to market with so many better options out there with more horse power  styling and utility with toyotas terrible safety record they didnt give it the badge but the scion and subaru in attempt to fool the public review
1 it can be a bit finicky to shift at times and is always begging for a speeding ticket but this car delivers a ridiculous amount of style and performance for
1 i am 47 years old and this little car puts a smile on my face every time i drive it heck every time i look at it
1 this is a modern sports car with none of the problems or shortcomings
1 i thought i would like this much better than i do
1 should have kept the miata
1 there are folks who wish for more power but i like the overall balance and the ability to really push the car without getting into trouble
1 i can not wait to buy my new scion !
1 they got it right
1 fun car and does attract attention
1 if you are looking at getting one please do you will be happy
1 if you are larger than average then getting into the seats that wrap around you is not going to happen
1 loved the general feel and look of the car if you dont carry extra passengers often or pick up tons of stuff at the store its a perfect fun choice
1 buy one and you'll see what i mean
1 the is a true sports-car
1 its not one of those lame muscle-cars like the mustang or camaro or challenger
1 this car is for enthusiasts not !
1 nice car fun to drive but slow
1 i definitely think that it was a great choice
1 i swapped out the stereo head for a tou
1 this is one of those vehicles that people laugh when you get out of
1 thats fine i ask then when was the last time you got change from a $20 when you filled your gas tank
1 consumer reports totally missed the mark with this prize of a car
1 the quality and attention-to-detail with the engineering is on-par with much much more pricey cars like the lexus and mercedes
1 but if you're looking for something small that gets above-average gas mileage and has some personality i'm looking at you prius family for a r

1 great handling fast accelleration loads of torque a crisp shifting 6-speed manual transmission and nice no-bologna interior make this car an excellent sporting
1 i never liked the xb before driving it
1 i thought it was ugly and disgusting
1 then i drove !
1 and mani was wrong
1 i'm not afraid to admit when i am wrong on this lol
1 i've never enjoyed driving a car so much in my life
1 the scion suits my driving habits and lifestyle perfectly
1 the car looks fairly small on the outside but there's load
1 not for everyone but for more than the media has given it credit for
1 it has been largely ignored as a credible option but that is a terrible mistake
1 not necessarily in the best way although this car makes most people smile
1 if you want cheap fun transport with a good warranty buy one
1 if you want the traditional american living room on wheels this is not a good choice
1 this vehicle is fun to drive although no speed demon
1 must use premium gas
1 if you accept what it is you'll do fine
1 this vehicle is a modern day computer laden safety
1 solid cool great mpg 42 +
1 i hate this car
1 if you are thinking about a harley take a ride in a smart cabrio with the top and side rails down
1 the manufacturer should be ashamed that a car twice the size gets the same mph
1 if everybody uses this car the traffic won't be here because these cars are so small they cant possible get into traffic but they could get into !

1 posted in 6 parts on youtube
1 including descriptions of some problems and a features wish list
1 a must see for tesla model s enthusiastsgo to youtube and search for tesla model s review
1 if you see a very negative review of a tesla it will be written by someone on the traditional automotive business
1 they are terrified of this car and company
1 well at least in the 52 years i have been driving to include a 64 and 68 'vette
1 a car of excellence beyond expectations
1 this car is the future
1 elon musk is a visionary who has taken the available technology to the next level and will continue to do so
1 it isn't exactly fair to compare this vehicle with ice or hybrid vehicles
1 it is in a class by itself
1 even then we are so ingrained in the way we think about interacting with
1 in the future all cars will be like this
1 there is obviously a reason why consumer reports gave it the highest rating
1 i truly believe this car has taken things to another level and will go down in history with elon musk alongside as one of the most influential innovations/innovators of our time
1 think about it

1 i want i want one i want one i want oh santa please bring me one
1 before my test drive another person showed up in a $150k car and even he was wowed by the performance
1 for local use this would be a great car
1 tesla can do a better job of sharing addit
1 we agree this car is destined to become a classic; it's truly groundbreaking yet achingly simple and precise in concept design and implementation
1 this is what american ingenuity is about
1 see pros and cons
1 this car may not be foreveryone but neither is a 911 corvette or panamera
1 as for range anxiety 95% plus of people dont drive a 100 miles in a day and rarely does anyone take their porsche 911 or corvette on a family trip of greater than 300 miles

1 on the other hand if you feel burdened a
1 awesome vehicle you must to appreciate what the buzz is all about
1 test drove it
1 i wouldnt buy it
1 not unless it was at least half of the advertised price
1 there is more bang for your buck luxury wise spening your 60k+ on a another brand and a gas motor with good milage
1 this car is a masterpiece; a treat to drive and a dream to own i'm sure
1 i'm trying to convince my fiance that this should be our next car
1 the car is away over-priced !
1 how can an average family or person afford ?
1 bring the price down
1 sell morelots !
1 it's an amazing piece of machinery
1 i think tesla should partner up with a hydrogen fuel cell complany to produce the electricity needed to charge the battery
1 as much as i like the model s i am more looking forward to the model x with its slightly higher field of view and the seating capacity for my whole family and cargo
1 i think this is a good car but it might need a new generation
1 very pour for so expensive car
1 this is a pretty good car to buy
1 as former owner of a lotus elise porsche boxster s bmw 3 series lexus is
1 i can honestly say this car handles better !
1 go with the ltd model in a 6mt and see how driving can be fun again
1 hard to find the 6mt in the pacific nw
1 great car for going through a mountain road
1 my local dealer offered me an incredible mind boggling deal to trade my genesis coupe for the brz and as much as i wanted the brz and that deal i passed it up because of the poor quality of the interior and
1 looking forward to spring and summer you better believe
1 bring on those old country roads
1 simply a suburb modern lightweight sports car
1 it's a japanese lotus they got it just right
1 a true sports car
1 absolutely great sports car with a good price and good amenities
1 her appearance is that of a higher priced vehicle
1 when purchasing a brz even though there is a back seat factoring in comfort it really is a two-seater  which is great
1 worth taking car of
1 great looking car at a not so great price when you should have recieved the ultimate machine from subarujust like mitsu and thier eclipse both companies missed the mark of what we want as tuners/sport car driversimho
1 with couple of options the price reach 30k
1 many options available at 30-35k such as sti evo nissan z
1 for 25-28 k i rather go for rallliart wrx base nissan z
1 excellent vehicle for someone who appreciates driving
1 i sell cars and i get to drive an exorbitant amount of vehicles in a month's time
1 the brz just did not wow me at all the way i was hoping it would and i was disappointed
1 got out with a mile-wide smile
1 yet to see another on the road in denver 
1 great platformhoweveri am going to wait for the sti version or the 2014 wrx or when a 4x4 version becomes available
1 still a very fun car to drive which turns alot of heads
1 looks more expensive than it is
1 diappointing price for a car lke that
1 good value for the money but a gti or mazda might have a bit more pep
1 i love the design perhaps in a year or two they will enhance the engine
1 if you just want a toy to play around with and don't live in the snow belt this is a good car to play with
1 there is no way i would drive this car in winter weather which makes this car  unusable almost 5 months out of the year
1 i was crazy for buy
1 subaru hit it out of the ballpark with the all new 2014 !
1 looking to be motor trend suv of the year for 2014
1 i feel the subaru delivers on the things i need: safety visibility and utility including handling rough roads; my complaints are about the more subtle details of the vehicle
1 great car and much more for your money than rav crvoutlander or equinox the others we considered
1 to top it off subaru also offers free break pads and wiper blade rep
1 i hope that subaru corrects this in the near future
1 they directed me to grand subaru bensenville il 32i limited andi got awesome price for all models
1 was prepared to buy but i think subaru took a step backward on seat comfort and steering feel
1 test drove the mazda cx5 first and compared to that model the subaru lags in handling and road feel
1 well built solid feel and very comfortable
1 aside from the defrost issue it's an excellent value
1 we also think the forestershould be made here in the us like the outback
1 but hate that speedometer
1 the turbo version drives very smoothly and quietly with only a touch of hesitation
1 appearance is a wash - the 2014 looks bloated with an aggre
1 the view around the vehicle is good  no blind spots
1 sunroof is huge
1 legroom front and rear
1 i was deciding between the rav 4 crv and forester
1 the rav 4 and crv in front wheel drive costed more than the all wheel drive forester
1 great vehicle for a family - for single guy driving in city not so sure
1 i really wanted to like this vehicle besides it's unnecessarily conservative looks
1 but how can you buy and drive a vehicle with substandard ?
1 well put together
1 the total package
1 if subaru fix the seats and the steering it will be good for the price
1 hope they have fixed the head gasket and oil consumption issues with this new design
1 i think the forester is a great vehicle
1 i just can't buy one at this time as i would feel a little embarrassed driving it
1 the look is so dated they could do so much more
1 inside is roomy but they made front seats smaller annoying
1 who doesn't offer
1 there is no other manufacturer that can deliver a unbeatable awd system and almost 9 of ground clearance for $20000
1 the msn website has minimal information to work with and much what is here is wrong
1 you have drive the forester to appreciate it
1 it is a far better buy than the outback because the outback is selling too well for dealers to price it more fairly
1 i looked at 3 other competitors which i had researched & all would have been excellent choices
1 run don't walk to get !
1 i owned two rav4's prior to this 2014 forester
1 they were both garbage in comparisonthis forester is the best thing under $30000i tested the rav4 escape crv and reviewed the others they were pathetic in comparisoncheck out some of the comparison v
1 it won suv of the year in a car !
1 overrated will not let you state your opinion 
1 this vehicle is hard to beat for it's price
1 this is another reason why subaru sales are soaring
1 a great little car that feels bigger than it is excellent fuel economy and handling
1 so it is safe and economical
1 great deal all around i looked at vw tdi wagons and their premium price tag was not worth the extra 2 mpg's
1 excellent car although acceleration is slow handling and breaking is very good
1 i get about 32 mpg combined which is excellent for an awd car
1 the car looks good and is very simple which is good for reliability
1 it will get you where you need to go in
1 i wanted a compact wagon or hatchback with all wheel drive
1 not too many of those from which to choose but the impreza suits my needs perfectly
1 im used to high perfomance 200+ hp but this is the first time ive actually been impressed with the impreza
1 people now days mostly need to sprint to 40mph
1 now i hear the xvcrosstrek will be produced as a hybrid in 2014 which will make leaps and bounds for the subaru name as being a fuel efficient economical automobile
1 i have yet to buy a new car with good tires
1 there are far better tires that cost less than the stockones that came with this car
1 road noise level much reduced with tire change out
1 i average around 30 mpg in the city
1 i had this car for couple days when my 09 impreza sedan was in for service
1 i'm not a fan of hatchbacks but after driving it
1 great fun and you can drive it in the wintersti and snow tires is there anything more ?
1 while not the perfect car its engine awd and suspension more than makes up for its deficiencies
1 if you enjoy the driving experience while keeping practicality this is the car for you
1 the 265 turbo-charged 4cyl engine will push you back in your seat with virtually no turbo-lag but at normal driving speeds you'll get about 25 mpg
1 just because it's awd you will for sure need snow tires
1 the tires they come with are summer tiresafter adding snow tires winter driving is way better
1 what i have come to expect from subaru
1 also it is built in indiana by american workers non-union i suppose  which is a plus in my book
1 the engine and cvt are built in
1 don't wait your time
1 cvt is not perfect but easy to live with
1 paddles are !
1 ok for the price but not what i want
1 drove for about 2000 mi on vacation and still had trouble starting smoothly - i can do better with a standard or automatic
1 i intend to buy one soon
1 this is the swiss army knife of !
1 this is the vehicle for you
1 however if you even remotely care about driving feel look elsewhere
1 acceleration is dog slow and noisy
1 love the new electroluminescent instrument cluster and having the temperature gauge
1 miss the compass in the rear view mirrow but the rear view camera in the r
1 this car is an all around winner
1 luxury when you need it with the outdoor fun when you want it
1 she is a beautiful car with many admirers - i am really enjoying having a look good; go anywhere; haul anything !
1 quick acceleration esp
1 for a 4-cyl
1 the styling is classy the mileage is very good and the eyesight feature is fantastic
1 the quality of this car combined with its utilitarian nature is outstanding
1 go with the 6 cylinder for better performance
1 they think of everything for those of us in snow country
1 a good sturdy car that handles snow well
1 great value but at performance sake
1 excellent multi-purpose vehicle
1 it seems to get a lot of negative reviews but the motor has a lot of power it has a very attractive interior and is built in the usa
1 what more can you ask for from an ?
1 i think it has the potential to become a new subaru flagship
1 this sporty crossover is a great find at this price point
1 easy to handle and safe in case you have small children
1 a great small sized crossover with appealing looks
1 typical subaru built like a tank and should last for several hundred thousand miles
1 i'd recommend this car over any similar car in it's class or pit it against any luxury vehicle offering a similar set-up
1 great looks good handling great gas mileage all of the bells and whistles
1 what is not to ?
1 buy !
1 mitsubishi outlander sport mazda cx5 and even nissan juke a better alternative to this ca
1 good car you pay for the name but resale is part of that too
1 i have been a toyota nut for decades but that manufacturer has fallen into the american trap of bigger is better 
1 after four 4-runners i could not take the giant size of the latest offerings
1 i wanted a car that was r
1 that kind of mileage means it is no race car but it gets down the
1 it was like the roads
1 this thing is solid solid solid
1 i have always loved subarus but still find them slightly overpriced
1 in the long-term i feel that i will not be di
1 hands down better service than the mercedes dealership trade in came from
1 buying any car no matter how costly is a compromise
1 i have been through
1 i give it an a+++++
1 again i feel like the xv is more meant for teenagers
1 a solidly built nissan with a suzuki !
1 that's a sensible answer to a chlalengnig question
1 very capable and competent small suv
1 if you want a reliable truck that is good on gas and i would last a long time buy a suzuki if you want pretty go somewhere else
1 suzuki has done an outstanding job with the kizashi
1 as a car enthusiast engineer and master automobile technician i i have driven and/or owned almost every car imaginablei wanted an inexpensive awd vehicle that would get reasonable fuel economy
1 i know some reviews mention it lacks horse ! says 89 gasoline and a k&n air filter can't be ?
1 safe as houses and performs well
1 you could pay double and not have what this vehicle has
1 ok but seriously considering a suburu or vw r
1 that's not like !
1 great package if you want a car that is not around every corner like a subaru/ honda/ toyota
1 just a shame nobody knows more about this car
1 i always smile when it is the kizashi's turn to get me around
1 since suzuki has left the us market any replacement vehicle i buy will be a letdown
1 suzuki announced in december that it was no longer selling cars in the usa
1 you cannot go wrong with the kizashi everyone say's thats a suzuki !
1 but now that they are pulling out of the us market
1 thank you suzuki
1 great car that has quality written all over it
1 there is no better deal for a quality awd anywhere
1 great idea styling & features
1 terrible execution poor reliability
1 can't believe they stopped making these in america
1 japanese designed small suv
1 nice vehicle to bad it going out of north america
1 this is a little shorter but heavier and more stable than the vibe
1 don't look for tons of room-it is essentially a small car with awd
1 the quality styling and features included are more than was expected at this price
1 this car will do very well for what it is desighned for
1 this is the same car as the fiat sedici in europe
1 i am 6' and 300lbs
1 best awd for the price in the entire market beats subarau by price almost $7000 loaded version of each least maintananced vechile in japan were they are the number one selling vechile
1 it's a really good car except for the transmission trouble
1 i really do like this little car
1 great idea styling & features
1 terrible execution poor reliability
1 sold it in less than a year for awd used matrix a better all around value
1 can't believe they stopped making these in america

1 it's a really good car except for the transmission trouble
1 you get a lot for a little
1 almost scary how well it does off road and how smooth everything feels
1 dealer told me that this 5th gen 4runner is back to it's roots of being a 4runner and no longer on the path to family cuv like previous generations i think i agree with this statelment
1 i expect the same quality from the 4 runner
1 i went to upgrade my ltd 05 to the new 2010 and was shocked
1 toyota takes its flagship ltd and strips most of the features that
1 real body on frame suv
1 solid truck built for off-road but regular driving feels like a chore
1 this is the suv that i have been looking for the last 3 years
1 trail edition if you are serious off roader sr5 if you are not looking to spend money and limited if you want it all
1 i think that toyota did a great job on the redesign as i never considered purchasing the previous models because they were just too stodgy
1 nicer than the lexus and costs less
1 mpg is very impressive
1 the best car under 40k hands down
1 plenty of space plenty of options interior is a huge upgrade from last years model
1 please check this car out after you have driven the rest
1 2013 toyota avalon is a bold surprise from the toyota brand
1 this rendering of the avalon gets more style and sleek lines flowing through-out the design body
1 wheels can be fitted from 17's to 18's and that chrome grill gives the avalon some swagger
1 i've tested & driven buick regal and lacrosse as well as cadillac ats really small for my 6'1 frame cts bmw & lexus
1 and for my money this car beats them all
1 it is a great looking vehicle and quiet
1 the avalon is an unpretentious auto that has surprising performance characterisitics great quality relevant features
1 it is not like the older models that are very sedate and buick-like 
1 the new body style and design are very nice
1 it has every thing you could ask for comfortstyle economy and easy of the pocket book
1 these items make supposedly toyota's top of the line car not such a great driving experience
1 i think it's a great !
1 toyota did a great job with the redesign for their flagship
1 shares many parts wuth lexus so if you don't require the prestige nameplate avalon is a better choice
1 i rent and drove it for 5 days and 800 miles
1 as mentioned above they tried to add some fancy touch screen and a/c control
1 but they failed at this point in my opinion
1 it seems priced right and i expect to see more on the raod
1 great job toyota for working hard on the all new redesigned avalon its just smaller for a large vehicle but saw few on the road and website its a beautiful car someone was in the market for a $40000-$50000 car i would talk them into buying a avalon
1 i love the looks of this vehicle
1 this car has everything that one could ask for in a vehicle
1 cross traffic warning blind spot warning dynamic radar cruise control loads of air bags great headlights extremely comfortable seats tons of room inside a large trunk for a hybrid
1 for the same $$ buy a !
1 the car is plain old fun to drive
1 go back to that ride
1 the 2013 toyota hybrid limited top of the line with all features avalon is very stylish has great acceleration and handles beautifully
1 a wow vehicle fit for old turkeys like me and young cats looking for fun and one heck of a vehicle
1 it is basically the lexus es 300h without the $5k extra for the badge
1 a professional reviewer said that the lexus es looks like the box the avalon came in since he thought the avalon had better styling
1 a wow vehicle fit for old turkeys like me and young cats looking for fun and one heck of a vehicle
1 today other cars make 28-31 in this class
1 i have owned autos that excelled in one or maybe two areas performance ride
1 toyota is on the right path now give us a venza !
1 this car is as much fun as either of those
1 but it uses regular gas is much quieter and its technology makes it safer
1 it is luxurious and well appointed
1 it has all the bells and whistles at a lower price and lower insurance than the luxury name cars
1 great for the environment
1 i really like that it is a hybrid
1 i was looking for a nice-looking sedan with room enough for all to comfortably fit - this fits the bill wonderfully
1 rides well and drives well
1 a significant improvement to the old less stylish avalon
1 it takes on an appearance very similiar to higher priced lexus audi and jaguar automobiles
1 liked the prius love the avalon
1 not much difference in mpg
1 at 80mph i got 41mpg with the prius and 434 with the avalon
1 everyday driving i go
1 this car definitely meets those 2 criteria
1 the gold-standard in where all manufacturers should be aiming in comfort handling room for a family and fuel economy

1 excellent car and an outstanding value
1 it is very good car for its class and price and also provided in the fuel and also the force that provided her a very good quality materials from the inside
1 i wouldn't buy this car even with a $10000 rebate
1 i don't care that it has the toyota name or not that alone doesn't make it a good !
1 led headlight are by far more exciting to look eit
1 best car on the road
1 not too big not too small
1 it also doesn't look like a corolla
1 so far this is the best car i tested
1 if you want a dependable and capable off road vehicle make sure to have the locking differential worth every dime then the fj is your best bet for the money
1 2014 is the last year that this car will be in production
1 whats up with that ?
1 but got the the 2014
1 so i will take care and enjoy this beast everywhere
1 the fj cruiser is a wonderful vehicle for small families or the avid outdoor enthusiast
1 the absence of interior carpet makes for easy clean up without sacrificing style or comfort
1 i can go darn near anywhere
1 the overall styling drive and off-road capabilities of the fj make it an suv to love
1 beaches - no problem
1 rain - please this is an fj a
1 traded a 2008 lexus rx350 for 2013 toyota highlander limited
1 i must add that the toyota service has been great too
1 from a previous 2003 bmw x5 owner
1 just go buy it please you wont regret it
1 cheap materials and poor workmanship
1 too new to rate
1 looked at many 7 seater optional v
1 great for short or long trips
1 good overall first impressions
1 i'm expecting toyota quality and dependability
1 ok for a mid -sized suv needs to be restyled
1 love the waythis vehicle holds its value
1 i love all of the safety features of the vehicle
1 it is a very comfortable and quite ride - either in the city or on the highway
1 too bad they are d/c d after 2013
1 get the ones left you wont be sorry
1 great value for worry free performance and !
1 i would suggest to everybody to try out the prius it is real nice every week to go to the gas pump after 525 miles and only put in 9 gallons each !
1 learn how to drive this car
1 the vehicle list was just over 25000
1 despite negative reviews for things like its aging looks
1 it says 2012 but our 3 cars are 2011 - did not
1 hybrid is the way to go just makes sense
1 my daughter told me to look at the prius
1 so i rented one for a weekend trip
1 the car suprised me how well it drove & how nice it was
1 the plug-in is a vast improvement to the prius concept
1 ps i will try to keep updating my !
1 i get over 50 miles per gallon on a regular basis
1 plus it is good for the environment
1 not good for my use
1 to be honest the prius is the only car i considered
1 i drive 65+ miles to work and back and really wa
1 outside of the great turning radius and the glitz of the instrumentation you cannot call this car fun to drive 
1 its trunk space appears to be limited maybe due to the battery/mechanicals underneath it's shallow
1 it's very slow to accelerate in econ
1 the leather seats have memory foam inside them
1 i would give this car a 10 and highly recomend this to anyone
1 from the store on one trip of 9 5 miles i got 71 mpg 
1 excellent car for driving in the city
1 first the fuel economy
1 better on gas safer more updated features
1 the car takes some getting used to because of its quirks hybrid based i think but once you know how to drive it
1 great car probably most economical option for a small car when figured with the hybrid fuel savings
1 can't wait until the plug in model is available in michigan
1 i give it a 10 rating
1 the prius v accomplished both tasks
1 it's surprising roomy on the inside
1 i've always driven suvs and it has that sort of spacing on the inside
1 i have a family of 5 with a son who is 6'2
1 we spent a lot of time researching & test driving different models
1 we considered the honda crv ford escape and hyundai santa fe
1 no su sport utility here; just another soccer momvehicle for the urban/suburban city slickers/masses
1 it rides like its on rails and i prefer the stiffness
1 anxious to take a long trip to see what the gas mileage is
1 not impressed with non-highway miles thus faravg
1 if your looking for a cheap price below retail msrp go for the ford escape 
1 if your looking for long term reliability pay the difference buy the toyota
1 ford talks quality but just is not the truth
1 ford still has been small problems with items like int
1 quality and reliability are always superb with respect to mechanics safety and interior/exterior mat
1 i'm new to the toyota family so we'll see
1 good looking exterior
1 i never even considered test driving a rav4
1 now im considering buying !
1 you can never be wrong choosing rav4
1 of the 5 we test drove we were on agreement the rav4 was it
1 if you are in the market for a crossover for some reason put the 2013 on your compare list
1 might as well take the bus than buy this car waste of money
1 interior materials are not what i expected and while i prefer the liftgate to the swingout door inter
1 one interesting observation is that everyone that my wife and i have met who own rav4s have only positive things to say about them
1 the right car at the right price is usually hard to find
1 toyota has done an amazing job with the new rav4 and it can be loaded with all the bells and whistles that you want at a price that you can afford
1 perfect for me at age 64 for traveling  shopping flea markets and just enjoying !
1 the best small suv on the market
1 while this isn't my dream car  audi a8 this is an awesome car
1 great vehicle in its class
1 lots of new features from the old rave 4
1 this is a great little suv
1 a great vehicle - excellent redesign
1 make sure that vehicle warranty covers all vehicle sensors
1 change ridges on top of front fenders
1 one drive is all it took
1 sporty looking but also very classy looking
1 if comparing to a honda crv see if the emergency brake foot pedal impedes your foot from resting completely on the dead pedal as it did for me
1 this is a fun vehicle to drive and the gas mileage is great
1 i believe this one will also exceed my !
1 if you wish a bit of sport and towing capability sorry about that
1 typical automaker new age approach
1 limit the offerings to maximize production efficiencies and reduce builder cost
1 i closely compared the sienna odyssey and grand caravan before purchasing
1 the sienna has the best reliability acceleration build quality and better bang for the buck than the odyssey
1 the engine is refined and provides outstanding performance comp

1 it's a luxury van that will do what it was intended to do
1 try it you'll like !
1 rides nicely  comfy spacious really nice van
1 one of the best van on the market
1 i have no hesitation in recommending the sienna given it's quality and the history of toyota reliability
1 vehicle has 1400 miles on it
1 called toyota and they informed me the remedy would cost me not
1 i compared the nissan frontier with the tacoma when shopping for a smaller truck
1 but preferred the tacoma in almost every other way
1 it is not a small truck it is clearly mid-sized
1 nice looking solid truck
1 if you are looking for solid reliable transportation and need to tow 5000lbs its tough to beat this truck
1 overall i consider the prerunner a well made truck
1 if you are looking for a good mid-size truck with great resale value
1 great resale value
1 i still have a soft spot for the ford eco-boost how
1 i don't know how anyone would be disappointed
1 perfect truck for !
1 i feel like i'm riding in a car
1 great truck for the money and performance
1 look elsewhere if you live in a cold climate
1 how this problem
1 unlike the person that thinks this is an expensive vehicle to maintain it is actually cheaper free for the first 25k miles than our honda civic and jeep was/is to maintain
1 tough trucks
1 i'm think i'll buy the full loaded double cab 4x4
1 i will probably never buy anything other then a toyota
1 gas mileage runs from 165 to 185

1 wait for the major redesign in in 2016
1 expect to see new a revised frame new engines and better mpg
1 also worst trade in value if you go to toyota regardless if you wan
1 rock-solid truck built to last
1 good looks practical performs well and durable
1 it is clearly a modern day station wagon
1 compare carefully before you buy this vehicle
1 took a while checking out all the different styles of venza
1 went to a few different dealers to find all the different trims
1 had to compare the v4 to the v6
1 then the fwd to the awd
1 just liked the way it drove
1 if your looking for style comfort and something a little different than all the other sedans on the road check out the venza
1 will recommend buying
1 i looked at a lot of crossovers the venza stood out above the rest
1 just think i was looking at a cheverlot equniox
1 glad they wanted an outrages price for it or i will have been in
1 however the interior appearanceis disappointing compared to the 2010
1 this was not good on my pocket
1 always wanted onelove the re-design
1 people love the tan over red combo and it gets lots of thumbs up
1 really surprises people that it is diesel
1 top up it
1 excellent new design and !
1 good gas mileage too if one can resist putting the foot down to hear the turbo
1 many improvements over my 2010 cc
1 all it took was one test drive
1 an excellent car much improved over the previous already-good 2010 model
1 this car is like taking a european vacation without the expense of a long flight
1 once you know the good and the not so good you will know if this is the car for you
1 the long and short of it is; do you live where a hardtop is really useful
1 i gave this car rating of 9's and 10's
1 perhaps that has to do with the convertible more than anything else
1 i narrowed my search down to the eos and the toyota solara convertible
1 special because you can't beat the mileage of this small and economic car
1 quality and overall performance
1 this 20 turbo diesel vw engine it is well proved outstanding motor and the car itself dominates th
1 do yourself a favor and look elsewhere
1 this car is also way under rated on miles per gallon
1 rated also at 42 ave on highway we have got up to 53
1 quality car as opposed to the us made jetta which ses cheaper components in a number of areas
1 for example the golf tdi as 4 wheel disk brakes

1 volkswagen continues to create practical and inspiring gti hatch that fits like a glove and handles like an obedient puma 
1 in one artful elegant and wonderfully understated package
1 it's a super fun car to drive: sporty & quick but easy to get along with day-to-day
1 as the old adage goes: it's funner to drive a slow car fast than a fast car slowwhile the gti is no rocketship it is fairly quick
1 note in europe these are premium c
1 if you want a faster car or a car with top of the line interior then the gti is not for you and you my want to go and buy a luxury sport car

1 i love the timeless plaid seats that hug you as accelorate through corners
1 overall it is a great car that is fun and practical at the same time
1 jetta seats one more than mercedes cls550
1 i kind of don't want to let people in on the secret diesel society but it is amazing
1 i still get questions like doesn't diesel fuel cost ? 
1 obviously people who didn't pass 4th grade math
1 never been a volkswagen fan before but if they keep up the fresh designs and great performance i may stay one for life
1 i've test driven a dozen carschryslers toyotas hondas 
1 it is worthy for the price
1 i don't know why would you want to spend money on prius
1 it is ok but i advise you shop & compare before making a decision
1 i love driving a manual transmission and the great gas mileage
1 but there is nothing excessive or fancy about this car
1 this is a very underwhelming vehicle
1 much better than a prius any day of the week
1 the best bang for the !
1 you get all the bells and whistles for the starting price of accords camrys etc
1 the best car in its segment at a low price
1 the best deal you can get
1 i'm afraid the performance of this vehicle will get me into trouble with law enforcement
1 this is the ultimate driving machine regardless what other makes !
1 would just restate that you want the diesel and manual transmission to get the most out of it
1 if they ever allow the e-ron diesel engine to be sold in the usa will trade up to it the day it's available
1 the sportwagen has the best of everything
1 this is a wonderful wagon great size and performance
1 though uglier and not as fun to drive i would recommend a prius v over this car
1 the rear seat is super roomy and the trunk is huge
1 i test drove many cars
1 small 4cyl cars with similar mile
1 this is a continuation of the consportion above
1 i ran out of charater space in that box
1 this was 1 week ago
1 sedan you can buy
1 luxurious enough and german to compete with cars that are more expensive even the rich cousin the audi a4/a6
1 if you commute or do a lot of highway drivingthe tdi is the vehicle for you
1 if you only drive around town and put very little miles on in a year then the tdi would be overkill stick with the gas model
1 the passat has many of the luxury sedan features space and comforts that we test drove for a fraction of the price
1 vw credit has a great lease option
1 when my 3-year lease on my dark silver passat se with pleather/moonroof/navigation is done i plan to buy a new or pre-owned '12 or later black tdi sel premium with the split-spoked alloy wheels
1 i've seen a handful on the road and that c
1 on the road the car is resp
1 the ride quality is good and squarely aimed at the us market in its handling but not what an owner of a previous german sedan would expect
1 averaging 40+mpg combined and thats not driving it conservatively at all
1 i expected a higher reliability for this car
1 a real pleasure to drive
1 may be a good option for those who prioritize handling
1 good looking van but not at all worth the money when you factor in the down time for repair
1 feels german even though it's not
1 plush ride and looks better than the competition
1 if you drive in the mountains or live at altitude you owe yourself a test drive
1 no other 4 cylinder ute that was non-turbo had the guts of the tiguan
1 would have liked to have a diesel tdibut that is not available in canada
