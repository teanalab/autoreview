2 owned a 2008 gmc acadia and it was a total lemon but we loved the design space and the look we decided to give a 2014 a try
2 so far we are very pleased
2 by far my favorite truck i have owned or tested
2 very happy with this truck
2 would not buy again
2 give it a 10 for great improvements over previous gmc 1500's that i have had
2 so far this is everything i have come to expect from a truck 
2 even in the coldest of weather  multiple days below zero   the interior fit and quality hold true the fuel mileage is better than the ford as well as the interior egromics 
2 have had no problems at all since i purchased the truck
2 buyers remorse this truck has major electrical issues
2 owned for 22 days been able to drive it 10 of those day because it is in the dealership for repairs
2 can not drive to far from home in case it breaks down waiting for back ordered parts
2 i traded 2011 ram wish i bought a ram or a ford
2 i would buy another
2 the best truck i have ever owned
2 i will buy another
2 i like the gmc very well and my wife feels real comfortable driving it
2 best vehicle i've ever owned safe and powerful
2 would not buy again i compromised on the power hoping for the better mpg well it delivered on the lack of horsepower but came up short on epa mpg ratings i get about 20 combined mpg and have never topped 25 mpg on a complete highway trip after now
2 traded in a 2010 mazda cx 7 and like this suv better more room quietier & smoother ride
2 it is a good value at the price--i received 0% financing and a $500 rebate
2 i had this vehicle since feb 12 and just traded it in for a gmc sierra 1500
2 i researched this vehicle for 2 years before buying the 2012 slt v4
2 one of the best and most appreciated new vehicle i have ever owned and driven
2 i went from a nissan pathfinder of 10 years to a gmc terrainhuge change but i got tired of the getting gas twice a week and i needed something smaller and new
2 very pleased with the purchase of this vehicle
2 i won't buy another one
2 i will go back to being a jeep owner
2 our daughrter bought this for a mom van trading an 8 cylinder truck
2 she likes the terrain and it suits her needs now but no power
2 i am pleased with my decision to purchase the gmc versus the audi a4
2 i like it and would buy another one
2 we looked at ford escape honda crv chevy equinox and other small/midsize suv's and none compared to what you get with the gmc terrain
2 love the vehicle and i have the 4 cyl awd in wisconsin
2 traded my envoy for this vehicle just for the gas mileage and for the noise reduction on the highway
2 i have 6 cy front wheel drive and i love my little car
2 previously i had a suburban and was just tired herding it around town and parking
2 i get a combined 27 mpg if i watch my driving style lay into it and it goes way down
2 best vehicle ever owned
2 it has plenty of power gets decent gas mileage and is very comfortable
2 until i found this i thoguht i'd have to spend the day inside
2 if not i would not even consider purchasing this vehicle again
2 would buy again
2 we have always had a suv but my first gmc & love it
2 i love it and would buy it again
2 disappointed in terrain even though the suv has a lot to love
2 would buy again
2 excellent i would not think twice about buying one !
2 good vehicle but with the 3800 and it's power train it would be better and perhaps a 95
2 love the car but really miss the safety feature of automatic lights
2 dont get this car you will regret it it is very cheaply built
2 2013 awd denali xl - very comfortable ride powerful great handling great exterior styling all the creature comforts of your living room plus room for storage for the driver and passengers
2 looks and drives great just wish gas milage was as advertised
2 the best car i ever had
2 very pleased so far
2 love it completely and rue the day when i get my first smack and run scratch/dent from a parking lot knucklehead
2 love it completely and rue the day when i get my first smack and run scratch/dent from a parking lot knucklehead
2 great car sport mode llove the economy of the car and the price is cheap for the quality and reliability microfiber seats are great
2 need more travel on the drivers sidecar should have heated side mirrors
2 i took more than one year to buy new car and in between i was going through numerous reviews test rides and friends experiences whoever bought any car brand in 1st week they were blown away but after some time you can see them back to reality
2 just got the car and have only have 150 miles on it
2 my first honda
2 honda ride quality lacks compares to other cars i owned but still a good car
2 was considering some german models but frankly the honda reliability won me over
2 the driving experience is so good that at times it seems surreal
2 unmatched in reliability and quality
2 nice car but i think i got a lemon
2 great handling blue-tooth back-up camera leather wraped steering wheel189 hp
2 we've been buying honda's and acura's since the late 1980's and this is the best accord yet
2 this is my first new car and i absolutely love it
2 the stock rims are fantastic i have the black on black sport trim
2 it is just the best midsize car around for daily driving long term ownership value all that good stuff is here
2 came from a 350hp subaru and was concerned that the 185ph i4 engine would not be enough power for me
2 glad i got the i4 with a timing chain never change a $1000 timing belt 40-46mpg and power needed to get out of traffic in a hurry
2 i would tell people about my car
2 this car fits our needs like a glove yet is great lookingj sporty and fun to drive
2 i am 6'-2and am comfortable riding in the back - so with one seven year old son this car will meet our needs for a long time
2 just purchased the 2013 honda civic lx auto and absolutely love it
2 i use it as a commuter car and i love it
2 this vehicle is a great value and very fun to drive
2 i just went from a 2010 civic dx l to a 2013 civic lx and i have to confess that i am surprised by all the new standard additions made to these cars
2 however i chose style over economy
2 this is the first car i have ever owned that does not feel like i paid too much for it has everything i need and then some at the right price
2 i just had this car for a week and i am happy i chose it over the prius c which i had also considered
2 very nice car for drive in the big city
2 i think the consumer reports score is way too lowit must be for the 2012 not the 2013 for the money not much out there to beat in with style  performance tech and mileage
2 the power is just right for its size and i am comfortable in the interior i don't feel cramped
2 i am very satisfied with my civic
2 i'm hooked on civics from now on
2 best car i ever owned
2 if it wasn't for the seats i'd give it a perfect 10
2 i had a 2008 civic that was wonderful
2 it drove flawlessly to 100k miles
2 i sold it and got a new one
2 i sure hope i can learn to like the !
2 enjoy driving it
2 excellent auto very versatile and drives well
2 so far i'm completely satisfied
2 great cross over honda you've done it again !
2 the ct is one of a very small number of available new cars that had enough room to accommodate my rather bigger than the average bearsize
2 it sits just high enough off the ground that it does not hurt my knees gettin
2 we really like our 2013 ct
2 it is well made comfortable driving especially on long road trips we get a number of people noticing the vehicle and make favorable comments
2 fun car to drive and very !
2 mine is 3+ years !
2 have not felt this way about a car since my very first one
2 love driving this !
2 this is the best overall car i've ever owned and i've owned lexus and mazda in the past
2 handles great in new england weather and on dry pavement
2 very comfortable smooth ride
2 i traded in a lexus gs300 for the crosstour mostly because i need more cargo room
2 i didn't want a full size suv since i like the characteristics of a sporty sedan
2 plus i did not lose any of the luxury f
2 it has the reliabilty of a honda saftey factors a plus comfortable smooth pleasure to drive easy access getting in and out doesnt feel like a truck or a bumpy sports car feels like a magical cross drives like a car the rear window u
2 my overall review is that this is an excellent automobile and would recommend it to anyone looking for a stylish all-around auto
2 handles well the v6 has enough power to get up to highway speed from ramps and into the flow of higher speed traffic
2 this vehicle is reliable and meets all my needs
2 i tested all popular models and this one won out
2 this is the second honda cr-v we have owned
2 i droved comfortable sport cars and coupes prior to buying this crv so it is very uncomortable to sit upright
2 having issues with the tire pressure warning light
2 it has come on 5 times it about two months back to the dealer 3 times no solution
2 honda america will inform me when a computer fix can be done
2 very unhappy driving with the light on review i
2 good for use around town but don't take it on a trip unless you want a back ache and ringing in your ears
2 very stylisheasy to drive
2 we were concerned that switching from our honda accord ex-v6 to the honda cr-v would cost us more to operate
2 but we were pleasantly surprised that our cr-v actually gets better mileage than our accord
2 i love driving !
2 this is my 5th honda after 3 civics and a pilot ex-l awd
2 is excellent for running around town and short trips down the interstate
2 had the cr-v for 1 month and found no flaws yet
2 this is my 4th generation of cr-v and it's getting better everytime honda redesigns it
2 love it will buy another
2 i'm a bachelor so the two seats are fine with me; but may not be for others
2 it's great to drive
2 handles great on wet roads
2 i'm so happy i bought the crz in february
2 it's one amazing looking car that's oh-so-fun to drive
2 as a lone commuter like almost everyone else on the road the two-seater crz has been perfect for me
2 after 6000 miles the fuel economy remains much better
2 this is my first suv and i love !
2 it is easy to park and has a small turning radius
2 i don't have to twist my back up for access
2 it's a really great practical auto if you own you will see
2 i bought this new at the end of january 2011
2 it feels safe but it does have a high profileoverall a good buy
2 people have frequently asked me how i like my car and i probably bore them to tears extolling the virtues of the honda element
2 i have put very little money into this car other than the normal wear and tear type things
2 spent only about $1000 in 9 years and 178000 miles since 2003
2 this is a car that i would buy again but probably won't have to because of honda's record of durabilaty
2 a car i would recommend highly lot's of interior spacegood mpg attractive design in the sport packagecar is a lot of fun to drive and has all the features i needed for a commuter car and it's peace of mind because it's a honda
2 i've owned only honda cars for 35 years
2 wouldn't even consider buying anything else
2 i love my new honda fit
2 nice car fun to drive great gas mileage with 5 speed manual
2 great oil change and schedule services at honda dealer for saving time and less stress
2 we love our little fit
2 great car will have it forever and when the motor goes out you can put in a bigger honda motor
2 when i bought the fiet i never imagined the real worth of this vehicle people want to buy from me
2 oh i own a 2011 model awsome little car immings
2 did i say i love my ?
2 should not pass up this car  worth the money and then some
2 good purchase and like the great mileage with a great ride
2 overall i'm very happy with the honda
2 it's safe and feels stable in adverse conditions
2 i would recommend this truck to everyone i know because of the smooth ride and storage
2 my truck fits my needs like a glove
2 my truck goes through snow like a knife through hot butter
2 love it i have owned 2 of them and will buy a third
2 it is a very handy truck for a person who occasionally hauls and tows but likes the feel and riding position of a truck
2 it isn't so big you can't park it but not so small you can't haul anything
2 so far no issues with the truck
2 first time i owned a 2008
2 it was not prep well but i think it was more that the dealer wanted to dump this unit since it had been sitting on their lot for 11 months
2 dealer gave me a great deal on my tradein
2 longevity will be the best determination of what i sum up this car to be but with the warranty it shouldn't be an issue
2 overall we are very satisfied with the azera and would probably buy it again
2 really happy with choice
2 really didn't want $4k primer package - big hot sunroof hard 19tires and few other toys
2 would buy again
2 better than the lexus es i traded in and $10000 cheaper than a new lexus esincredibly spacious
2 i am 6'2tall and never have to move my seat up to make room for passengers in the backcan't imagine why hyundai doesn't do anything
2 i thought my sonata was a great car but the azera goes way beyond it in offering a quiet luxurious ride; beautiful head-turning styling; and an incredible array of tech gadgets and gizmos that i marvel at every time i use them
2 this is my third azera from 2008 to 2010 until now a 2012
2 i am so impressed with this car that i bragged about it at the 2013 philly auto show also there is not enough room given here to go into detail about my satisfying experience with azera
2 my second azera  have a 2007no problems after 75k hope this 2013 gives me the same reliability
2 the value to me was with all of the options this car is less money than all of the competitors wi
2 hands down best car i have ever owned
2 i compare my azera to my previously owned lin
2 i love my new car
2 i love this car once we test drove it i had to have it
2 got a great deal and for all the bells and whistles on this car the avalon would have cost well over $40000
2 great car for the cost looking at purchasing a second one
2 getting almost 30mph on hiway quiet smooth ride very stylish
2 i have owned many cars in the last 40 years but this is the best automobile ever
2 i had to put it in the garage as it is so fun to drive
2 the accent has come a long way over the last 5 years and i would rececommend this car to anyone looking for a car in this price range
2 it's everything i expected
2 i bought the russian version called hyundai solaris because it's not sold in other european countries
2 after a couple years i'd like to revisit this review and see what i have to day then
2 i travel mostly highway miles a commuter car so its puuurfect for me; and after a two and half months of ownership who needs a elantra or a ?
2 the car has a bulletproof engine and transmission somewhat basic suspention could be a little stiffer but steering is nice and tight needs a little practice to get it to go straight this car has the capability to last a very long time you just need to
2 i have had my 2012 accent since july 2011 no problems and it rides wellin the winter traction is sometimes a problem but usually when other cars also have the same problems
2 i enjoy driving this car but if i had it to do over i would buy another elantra
2 hyundai has a good reputation and i get over 40 miles per gallon on trips
2 have been running a test with this tank of gas and keeping car at 6
2 i own a kai soul also
2 bought this car after reading reviews and test drove looking at the mpg listed on the sticker
2 well my mileage has been lousy and i complained to hyundai corporate and all they are doing in giving me the run around sending a speedsheet to track my mileag
2 in the city where we do most of our driving we avg 20-25mpg
2 we bought this car because my wife was expecting
2 should have bought a subaru or honda civic for the price vs mileage
2 much worse than i planned for and very poor at being honest about it all
2 i bought a 2013 base model with auto transmission
2 i get emails service reminders and let's not forget 100k ! a certified master auto tech i chose this car for the reputation value and dependability
2 i bought this car after reading recommendations from consumer reports
2 i am not impressed overall with hyundai and will probably not buy another one
2 i have owned the 2013 elantra coupe since 07/2012 & am already scouring the internet to find a replacementany body got a ?
2 i have been very impressed with my 2013 hyundai elantra
2 my daughter just bought one as well and she loves it
2 i also have a sonata limited and this car is equally fun to drive for a lot less cost
2 i'd give this car a perfect ten if i had the engine broken in but to be fair i gave the acceleration a 9 because i haven't put the peddle to the medal for fear of breaking in the engine !
2 i like this car my wife loves it so i'm a happy camper
2 car drove good gas tank runs small
2 came homedrove my honda and felt like i was driving a tank compared to the elantra
2 i feel i was taken advantage of because of hyundai's inflated advertised gas mileage of 28 to 40 mpgthe car felt good and is roomy but the main reason i bought it was because of gas mileage
2 again not dissapointed by buying an elantra
2 with the design of the easy to usecontrol center my eyes are never off the road for more than a second or two
2 this 2013 se-coupe m/t is probably the best small car i've ever !
2 for the money i would do it again
2 i have just over 4000 miles on this car
2 until last fillup my mileage has increased with every tank
2 my last tank i averaged 355 mpg
2 in short i love my elantra and intend to drive it for many years
2 i really like my 2013 elantra and i'm glad i bought it
2 my average mileage with a combination of highway and town driving is about 28 mpg
2 if mine is listed in the recall i will most likely sell and never go back to hyundai
2 just purchased new 2013 gls
2 purchased through costco program
2 $25k list price bought for $ 22k with extended warranty comfortable ride for 62' driver
2 i drive 40miles round trip to work 90% is freeway and the mpg goes from 27 to 38mpg
2 this car rides nice with comfortable seats
2 nice handling and good acceleration and gets around 30 mpg not 40 mpg
2 except for the visibility problem i am happy with this car and think i picked the best of the batch according to my criteria
2 on the good side is the warranty all 3 of my hyundais were bought from the same dealer never a problem with service
2 the only thing is it is missing is less than superb drivability
2 very pleased with !
2 the steering seems to be an issue with some but you get used to it
2 i use the cruise control a lot even in town to maintain and adjust speed which also helps the mileage
2 i am very happy with my car
2 my car buying experience was very pleasant i did not feel pressured or stressed
2 great car has all the toys my tl had plus backup camera keyless startup nav system works great
2 it handles well but the brakes can be touchy at times
2 i have had it for almost a year now no problems to speak of !
2 the air vents are a little lower than most cars but i got use to them pre
2 i own the new 2006 elandra
2 at less 6-year and 34k mileages the radiator and engine died suddenly without any sign with a lot of coolant spreading and engine smoking
2 i drove the sentra and dart loved the turbo engine but when it came to the bottom line the others weren't close
2 i don't regret buying the elantra
2 good looks very safe excellent mileage100k warranty glad i opted for the manual
2 i would buy this car again in a minute
2 im satisfied with the price and performance and for me that says alot cuz im a picky fat man to put it politely
2 brakes need to be addressed/recalled to be corrected
2 high maintenance and not a smooth ride
2 already in the shop with only 500 miles on the car
2 decent enough car but i feel cheated into it through false mpg claims
2 love my car
2 i ran out of room in my cons so to continue i wish the rear seat armrest had a window in it to pass through skis pipes and other long objects without folding down the seats
2 our current 2009 honda civic and previous honda fit both have lower epa mileage estimates than the elantra but get better mileage same driving70% highway and 30% cityyou will be lucky to get 30 mpg with 70% highway driving on the elantra
2 comfortable on long trips
2 did well this winter on icy roads
2 we love the heated seats
2 i would definetly buy this car all over again
2 i'm very pleased with my elantra and am not at all disappointed even having come from a 6 cylinder
2 i don't feel that i've stepped downat all
2 it has a comfortable ride and looks great for a smal
2 so far cant say anything bad about the car very comfortable riding car and for the price you cant beat it
2 i'm happy with this purchase
2 my car has 600 miles on it now and for the money this car is hard to beat
2 i owned a 2002 sonata that has 193000 that i kept for a work car for me
2 overall veey happy with car 1st i have boght since 1970 that is not a toyota
2 hopefully time will show the durability that has kept me in the toyotas
2 overall the 2013 hyundai coupe is a pleasure to drive
2 with hands-free blue tooth capability very responsive controls and a surprisingly quiet for it's size and gripping ride i'm really happy with my car purchasing decision
2 i'm getting along quite well with the car
2 comfortable driving i feel safe excellent response on the road
2 thats the biggest reason i bought it
2 its a great starter car and i'm very likely to keep it for at least 10 years i wont trade it in
2 not enough time in vehicle to evaluate long term
2 not enough time in vehicle to evaluate long term
2 overall i am very pleased with this car and would recommend it to a future buyer
2 great car for the price had a dealership who were very friendly and helpul in the decision no !
2 the warranty is super ride is smooth lots of leg room trunk is large
2 just purchased the 2013 elantra gls after test driving about ten cars
2 the price was good
2 we drove over 2500 miles and spent less than $20000 on !
2 great car and fun to drive 42 mpg on 1 1/2 hr trip avg speed 63
2 this is my first hyundai but not my last
2 i was able to get as much luggage into my elantra touring as we did in a much larger suv
2 i travel locally about 30000 miles a year for business never had a better car
2 i added rims and wheels for a more professsional look
2 got the gls auto model which in canada has a sunroof and alloys along with bt leather wheel and knob
2 dealer included a hood stone deflecto
2 i enjoy this vehicle which is safe to carry my granddaughter around plus my familylots of storage spacethe only thing i am disappointed is with dealersalesman had told me had bluetooth and months laterwhen i needed it and asked for it was advi
2 despite the list of window and rear view problems i would buy the car again
2 i've adjusted to the lousy rear view and i like the other features
2 when comparing brands and models i did extensive research and this car won without serious competition in
2 hyundai sales and service have both been tops though i haven't had any service done outside of the scheduled maintenance
2 the warranty is also pretty impressive but i haven't had occasion to take advantage of that either
2 all the past vehicles we have purchased from hyundai have been reliable and affordable !
2 i would have had it sooner if i knew it existed
2 don't buy this car like having this cool unique baby all to myself
2 time will tell if it will hold up
2 we've taken two long road trips of over 2500 miles each with no problems
2 the car is awesome to drive its a better deal then infinity g37 and bmw 335i it gets lots if looks and it's fun to drive
2 the 370z is nicebut this car gives you everything that car has plus more room and even a little bit more hp for less $$$$i love it and proud to own !
2 i got the type of car i wanted with the features i wanted for the price i wanted and i can live with
2 best coupe you can get for your dollar highly recommend cant go wrong with hyundai backing with warrenty and price guaranty for 4 yrs
2 i just purchased a bright red manual transmission 2013 track version
2 it is my second one i own first one is a 2010 track yellow
2 i traded in my 2008 bmw 535i for it
2 i love driving this car
2 mileage around town has been 23
2 i'd recomend this car to anyone looking for a coupe its very good and its pricing makes it only betterfrom a daily driver to a project car it cant get any better
2 i bought the 2013 hyundai genesis coupe gt 38 liter back in september and have absolutely no regrets
2 this baby flies and handles better than any car i have ever driven especially when it comes to cornering due to wide wheel base
2 i have had my but kicked by only one car a gtr  understandablylove the car  drives at 150 mph like your doing 80 
2 may be the best auto i've ever owned
2 previously had veracruz 5 years lincoln cadillac and mercedes
2 overall i am very happy i bought the genesis
2 i must admit i was nervous about trading in my benz for a hyundai but now i'm glad i !
2 the car gets a pretty good ride on the freeway and it still handles pretty good for a car of that size
2 overall great car i just dislike having to continually clean soot to maintain it's otherwise impressive looks
2 excellent  loves this car much i made the right choice couldn't get it any better
2 a very nice car replaced my bmw
2 i leased it and didn't get any incentives at all maybe i should have bought it outright and paid ?
2 i traded a 2011 genesis 46 for the 2013 38
2 i've had bmw lexus acura mercedes and this 2013 genesis is hands down the best car i've e
2 we have the 38 engine and i laugh when i read consumers saying this engine is not powerful enough
2 while driving on the freeways in la i have no trouble keeping up with t
2 i have been very well served by my genesis and recommended both the dealer and the car to others
2 was not looking for a new car but the new styling was too good to pass !
2 not quite the same get up and go as the rav4 but the turbo has enough oomph to push you back into your seat
2 this is my 4th hyundai and 2nd santa fe
2 the turbo is quick and thus far i have not experienced any turbo/lag 
2 the engine is smooth and there is no power lag when passing or when you need speedand you will feell that power
2 great vehicle so far i have only had it for 2 weeks
2 buy one you will love it
2 overall i love my car just wish i didn't have the glitches as its brand !
2 paid enough for it and in the oldest of cars i've owned never had issues with the radio of all things
2 my first non honda for some time
2 did a lot of research and happy with this vehicle
2 hopefully we will get 12 years out of this one like our last one
2 paid 31k before tax & went with the 1k extra for the 10 year bumper to bumper warrant
2 plus you have the long hyundai warranty peace of mind
2 i just purchased the car 1 week ago and have traveled about 500 miles int eh car on all types of roads
2 i now have a great suv that can be seen
2 i really like this car and would recommend buying it to everyone interested in a mid-size suv built in the usa
2 i researched this vehicle for months before buying and just love the range of features solid build sporty looks and fuel economy for base model + popular equipment package
2 not as common on road as competitors which is a good thing
2 has great quality inside with premium materials
2 turbo engine has plenty of power and the awd is great
2 this car has it all; comfort speed style and room
2 very happy with the 20 pulls better than the 54 v8 in my last vehicle
2 i find the interior styling simply georgous the luxury almost matches my acura in
2 i miss the cornering and tightness of the auto but love sitting higher
2 i still catch myself looking at it when it's parked and say that's a hot looking design
2 for those worried about running lights turn your lights on and leave them on all of the time i do they shut off autmatically
2 i have owned this vehicle for about 2 months and have about 2200 miles on it
2 satisfied so far with the way it rides and handles and very quiet interior
2 very pleased with around the city and highway drivinggreat suv for a road tripwould recommend this vehicle for anyone in the market for a midsize crossover suv
2 owned my sfs20t fwd for over 3 months  1700 miles 
2 still no problems with the vehicle at all so far
2 purchased the 20t fwd w/ tech package blk with beige leather interior
2 we own two other hyundais and have been very satisfied with their reliability and overall performance
2 other than fuel gauge no other problems w/carvery comfortable to drive good paint and interior
2 i'm looking to trade it off
2 very happy with it
2 this is my second hyundai santa fe i still own a 2005 model v6 and my daughter drives it which still runs great at over 90000 miles
2 so far we are fairly happy with the car itself but very disappointedwith the bluelink
2 i would recomend this vehicle i own !
2 would buy a second one for the family if i could
2 over all in comparison to the many suv's i have owned i really am impressed witht he !
2 overall this is my favorite car purchase ever
2 i usually suffer buyer's remorse after a few months but this time i have been fully satisfied
2 overall very pleased
2 i enjoy sometimes using the tiptronic transmission and go through the gearswhen i'm feeling a little sp
2 owned for six months and 11000 miles2013 hyundia santa fe front wheel drive basic package
2 could not be happier with the features and performance for the money as long as the car over time does not develope problems caused by cost cutting assembly and design flaws
2 i would buy this car again in a second and highly recommend it to others
2 this is my second sonata
2 i have a 2012 with the manual transmission and the 2013 with the auto
2 wouldn't by another one
2 it is a very nice car to drive
2 finish looks very nice as long as you do not drive it anywherequality issue with finishes and blue linkextremely poor customer service
2 the camry was a close second choice but didn't drive or handle as well as the sonata & the it looked blah next to the sonata
2 looks good rides good but i wouldn't buy one again
2 very happy with my purchase
2 i am very pleased with my 2013 sonata
2 overall hyundai did an excellent job balancing gas mileage and performance and skimped in the areas which are easily upgradeable in the aftermarket area for the base model
2 nicest car i've owned  the se stance and the venitian red paint is just gorgeous !
2 my wife and i purchased this car on march 26 2013
2 i like the car after driving camry's for the last 13 years is is a refreshing difference
2 one of the best vehicles that i have owned
2 we switched from a nissan altima 35 10 years 180k to the hyundai sonata which was a difficult decision
2 we have put about 5k miles on the car including trips and couldn't be happier with our purchase
2 love the car a steal for the money
2 i traded my 2011 dodge ram for this car for the gas mileage
2 my second hyundai and not my last
2 i'm a former toyota owner solara and after 7 years in that car i switched to the sonata because of the value for the money
2 i'm very glad i !
2 the car is so comfortable and i love all the features that are offered for the !
2 i have no regrets at all about my decision to buy this car
2 would do it again tomorrow if i needed another one
2 on my 4th hyundia they keep on getting better-flat out beats competion in price warranty and performance
2 best car i have ever owned or rode in
2 i had a camry but decided to go with the sonata this time after some thought i believe i made the right choice
2 this car offers everything i need in a daily driver family commute and sporty fun ride
2 we have put our first 12000 miles in with zero trips to the dealer and no complaints
2 we have received many compliments on the look of the car and most are shocked when we say it's a hyundai
2 we were going straight to the nissan dealership but on a whim stopped by the hyundai dealership across the street took a test drive then went straight to the office and purchased the !
2 have had this car limited for three months
2 other than minor annoyances mentioned this has been an outstanding car
2 would buy again
2 plain and simple i was impressed with the test drive and walked off the lot with my sonata 1 hour later
2 it handles great seats are comfortable and the vehicle takes long or short ride very
2 i'm not thrilled with mine at all
2 i would buy another hyundia again
2 this sonata is accutally my second
2 i had owned a '09 elantra beofre this and had no issues what so ever
2 i really love my car it serves the purposes we bought it for and we got many features for a lot less then other comparable optioned vehicles
2 i owned an elantra
2 salesman made me do it
2 and the warranty is exceptional
2 we were almost ready to by an suv santa fe/crv but one drive in the 2013 sonata and we fell in love
2 not a bad car for the money but i probably would have gone with something else had i done my research
2 overall the car rides nice but there are a few defect with my 2013 sonata
2 this car is fine for me now but i probably would purchase a smaller vehicle next time
2 the car is sharp -no doubt; after 7 months of ownership i still do a double take after parking and walking away the acceleration lag is annoying to me but i think i am getting used to it and if you ask my wife it has led me to better driving habbits
2 i seldom purchase the same make of car twice but  i'll make hyundai my first choice when i start looking for another car
2 i'll probably be keeping this to pass down to one of my grandchildren
2 i've owed camry's accords and mercedes andam extremely satisfied with my new 2013 hybrid
2 we like this vehicle and are very pleased with our purchase
2 great on fuel - fun to drive - i'll never be able to get my wife out of this vehicle
2 my 6'3friends aren't afraid to ride in my car they actually prefer !
2 i would not purchase another hyundai for three reasons: 1 the dealership was unfair in negotions  2 the tires were poor and wore out too soon w/no warranty and 3 it is not good on gas
2 it has some cons but its looks great drives even better and it will make you smile every time you drive it
2 first time owner of a hyundaisee how it does when we take a trip in a couple months
2 love my hundai
2 love driving it around the denver metro area during the week and up to the mountains on the weekends
2 will definitely consider purchasing this vehicle again when it's time to update
2 very comfortable good milage few problems

2 the is my second hyundai and this suv will make me buy a third hyundai
2 i am very happy with it
2 my wife has 2011 tucson limited awd and loves it and i wanted something higher than my previous elantra; so i bought a fwd gls as our second vehicle
2 except for the spongy breaks i can live with the rest
2 we were between the crv and the tucson and the heated seats on the gls tipped the scales for us
2 this car makes our 1000 mile treks to our daughter in college pleasurable
2 our second hyundai
2 the gas mileage is great for an awd we're getting close to !
2 i have only owned it for two weeks but i am impressed with how hyundai stepped it up from the 2005 model i just traded in
2 i would totally suggest this car to anyone that wants to have a stylish yet functional and practical car this hits all the angles for me and i will be driving this car for a long time
2 you're going to save money on gas and enjoy driving again
2 you will be patting yourself on the back for having

2 i'm really glad i bought this car
2 really like this vehicle gets a lot of looks on the road also when i go places i get a lot of questions asked about the car
2 i'm sure it will go down in my history books as one of my favorite cars
2 i plan to keep it long enough to pass on to my kids
2 i have owned mine a couple months now and love it
2 i would definately reccomend it as an option if it wasn't for the stylish body style i would have swayed towards the elantra which my p
2 we have enjoyed owning this vehicleusing it around town as well as on long trips
2 we have not encountered any real problems with it at all
2 my only real complaint is the poor gas mileage
2 bought 2 i liked it so much

2 quality feature set is just right quiet no road noise is coming into the cabin except 37 liter engine roar when pushed
2 i'm delighted with my new q50 awd hybrid
2 the car drives beautifully and it's packed with features bells and whistles
2 as an overall comparison we also own a 2013 cadillac ats4 premium 36 and a 2013 bmw 335 x-drive luxury line and the q50 s awd
2 i am very happy with the q50 sport hybrid
2 the system has to boot when the car starts and will spontaneously reboot occasionally while driving
2 if you have never had one you will have another and another or you may never need but onei've seen 420000 miles on these cars and they still look drive perform with stylei've had acura audi subarusaabv
2 i will go back to my audi in 2-3 years when i trade again
2 i've driven infinitis for the past 12 years and i have found them relatively trouble free and nicely designed particularly the first generation g sedan and coupe of which i owned both
2 i've owned a great many performance cars two gto's corvette audi tt shelby mustang two mustang gt's and 4 jags among others and this is by far the best and most enjoyable to drive
2 i've had it for about 3 months
2 this is my 8th jag and it will be my last
2 my ninth jaguar in the past twenty years and the best of them all so far !
2 have had the car only a little more than a month
2 we'll see how it holds up over time
2 when you are driving it casually it can be soft and comfortable and quite frankly a joy to drive but when you find yourself staring at a newly found curvy road it can be anything but subdued
2 the new jeep cherokee is everything its predecessor was and much !
2 no buyers remorse
2 loving everything about our trail hawk so far and we have had the weather to prove !
2 very comfortable seats and excellent driving position
2 transmission is beginning to adjust to our driving style i believe and it can only enhance our enjoyment in the future
2 overall very pleased with my purchase
2 been a ford owner most of my life i'm happy to say i think i've crossed over to the dark !
2 overall i couldn't be more pleased with my purchase and anticipate long lines to get the trailhawk model; she's a beast
2 excellent choice and great millage
2 we have only had our trailhawk for 2 weeks now but have been in thick sand off roading on trails and in snow
2 we have gotten lots of compliments
2 in the end the other attributes of the cherokee overcame my disappointment with cargo space making the 2014 jeep cherokee a !
2 we love our new cherokee
2 we had to wait quite awhile for it but it sure seems worth the wait
2 we bought the limited with almost every option
2 all i can say is a pleasant surprise to find a great smaller suv with a lot of perks for a pretty low pricewith great mileage
2 big improvement from the 2012 patriot that i traded in even though the insides are idential
2 not a totally bad vehicle if i did not have all the electrical problems i would be pleased with the vehicle
2 right now far from the most satisfied customer
2 had the vehicle for 3 days and the electronic dash board went blank
2 6 days later the navigation system went blank
2 a week later the radio screen froze

2 love love love my new cherry red jeep
2 i read the reviews before i bought my 2014 grand 
2 with it comes a few problems like anything else
2 had remote installed not one problem with it but to read the reviews you would think it was the last
2 worst vehicle i have ever owned
2 problems were intermittent and unpredictable
2 i am very happy to have bought another jeepit compares to the ml and is more enjoyable than an audi q5 egg salad without mayo
2 i am very pleased with this vehicle which replaced my 11 year old grand cherokee
2 i liked the old one but this is a step up in terms of luxury and performance
2 you could spend less and get one of the other versions of the grand cherokee but my decision to but the summit was based on the ride and the appearance
2 i have only had this for about a month now and am still learning my way around it
2 i have only had this for about a month now and am still learning my way around it
2 overall i am extremely happy with my liberty
2 thanks to jeep's cash incentives and dealership discounts the price of this new vehicle was a bargain
2 i went from a grand cherokee to a liberty
2 it looks great and rides very well
2 this is my 2nd jeep liberty and the 12th jeep in my family
2 we have never had any issues with our jeeps and have always loved that they would make it through any winter that was thrown at them
2 it's an ok vehicle but if i had been able to forsee the problems i would not have purchased it
2 good vehicle to own
2 good rugged american style vehicle needs a little refinement
2 it tows a camping trailer well is good off road handles and ride comfortably is practically sized and after a year of ownership has been perfectly reliable
2 i purchased a 2012 jeep patriot but only owned for 3 months just was not right for me cheap interior seats uncomfortable and no power

2 i bought it before productions discontinued !
2 we bought the jeep as a replacement for my thirteen-year-old college car
2 we've owned it now for six months and with the exception of the roof side rails and the amount of gas we go through we are happy with our purchase
2 great suv amazingly capable and reminds me of previous cherokee
2 despite poor gas mileage you won't be driving the new cherokee disappointment set out by jeep
2 great truck tough strong good control feels great while driving
2 i recommend it for people who like the feel of a real truck but want something that's not tremendous and takes up lots of space
2 mine has been very reliable
2 i use synthetic fluids and follow all maintance requiremnts and i did bring the noise of a driveline clunk to the dealers attention

2 the perfect family jeep: great for retirees as the main vehicle
2 i normally drive toyotas so this was an unusual vehicle choice for me
2 it took a lot of searching to find a nicely equipped patriot with the 5 speed transmission but it was worth it
2 i just went over the 200k mile mark on my 2004 tacoma
2 would buy another in a heartbeat
2 12000 miles not one problem
2 i would purchase this vehicle again

2 only own this for about 2 months but am very happy
2 if you can find one at a dealership buy it you will not find a better car value
2 the sound system is one of the best and i can even put pictures of the family on the screen
2 if you're looking for a car that has all the options of a an expensive car but is reasonably priced buy a cadenza

2 i like luxury without the badge and wanted a car that i feel i can live with for many years

2 i traded a 2013 bmw 750i for my 2013 lexus gs350 and so glad i didwatch out bmw here comes lexus

2 the v6 with the 6 speed transmission is silky smooth and as an enthusiast with many bmws in my past i don't find
2 i have been driving the 2013 for about 6 months and i love it
2 i have driven this in the winter and the all wheel drive model
2 will always own a lexus
2 i have owned this car for 3 years and can tell you it is not that smooth
2 the vehicle handles exceptionally well in snow and ice
2 best car i have ever owned
2 wife loves the car so that's all that counts
2 it is a great car except price
2 spouse and i really like the ride fuel economy and overall workmanship of this vehicle
2 excellent handling suv very user friendly a pleasure to driveexcellent quality suv
2 except for some inital quality issues i absolutely love this car
2 comfortable super quiet very smooth ride
2 i look forward to driving it for many years
2 excellent car with great service
2 awesome ride had it for 3 weeks find places to go just so i can drive
2 our mkt listed for close to $60000 and we got a great deal
2 the ecco-boost engine is world class but have not yet checked gas mileage
2 for the price i paid hard to compare best in class
2 love the sync much improved over earlier versions
2 read professional reviewers comments they must not have spent much time with the vehicle as those reviews did not reflect my experiences at all
2 was very impressed by lincoln more people need to test
2 this crossover is a gem and doesn't get the respect from the auto reviewers that it deserves
2 you would be hard-pressed to find a better luxury crossover anywhere right now and we have tried them all
2 feels like a rocket with the eco boost
2 great lovely car with so much available amenities and wonderful family hauler
2 while i can get bored easily the mks is a keeper for the reasons that i mentioned above
2 i previously owned a 2010 mks eco boost and i absolutely loved that car
2 i upgraded to the 2013 mks eco boost and it is a totally different car
2 i've only owned it for about a week and i am already impressed with it and for the naysayers out there that
2 best car ive ever owen
2 my mks is by far superior to all other vehicles i have ever owned including my previous 09 mks other lincoln models and other brands
2 i get consistent comments about how different the car is from what people who see it had thought
2 i don't even like the dealer i deal with but for this car i'll put up it
2 completely satisfied
2 will by again - this is my 3rd lincoln
2 you will be missing out if you don't add this vehicle to your list to try
2 very happy that i purchased fun to drive home from a hard days !
2 it is responsive quiet and comfortablewho would have ever thought a v-6 could generate so much power from a little 35 liter engine
2 the car is quiet rides well and put together well with a lot of features for the price
2 before you criticize the car for foreign models take it for a test drive
2 great car for a reasonable price for all the options you get
2 i have premium and elite package that gives you everything
2 i think the lincoln mks is the best car i have ever owned
2 had problems with the vent system since i bought the car
2 a/c defrost would periodically vent out on your feet only
2 very much a problem on a hot day or a day when it was raining and you needed a defroster
2 good purchase
2 hazardous navigation system
2 very disappointed
2 the fwd gas milage is better than we thought just under 25 mpg for city driving
2 the lincoln my touch works just fine
2 in order to take advantage of everything the car can do be prepared to read and refer to the owners manual for a while
2 as i drive it i occasionally need to look
2 would be an almost perfect vehicle except for the frustrating my lincoln touch issues
2 excellent vehicle i have no complaints
2 i made a very poor choice when i bought this car
2 we are very pleased that we purchased this car after spending a lot of time looking at the comparable vehicles from other mfgs
2 i went back to the dealer i bought the car from and was told there was nothing they could doi notified the company but the company totally ignored my complaint
2 i am not sure i will buy another lincoln again
2 i lease my vehilces and would recommed the lincoln to one and all
2 very satisfied with overall purchase
2 very classy appearance and a smoother ride than the murano i owned prior to purchasing this vehicle
2 the sync system has a big problem with siri on the iphone
2 i have sold lincoln's for 21 years and owned a 2001 before i leased my 2013 mkz
2 this car is by far the best in quality i have seen come from lincoln
2 the 2011 was a great car and rated best in dependability and i think this car is head and shoulders abo
2 this car is drawing attentiona great indicator for future of the !
2 i have had all ages complement style of the new mkz from the high school kids to heir grand parents
2 she loves it but she traded in a 2011 lincoln mkz that she loved
2 this is an extremely unique vehicle made by a car company willing to raise the bar
2 overall i am extremely happy with my lincoln mkz
2 if you test drive it you will purchase the mkz
2 very pleased with everything about the car
2 it's a great auto i am happy i bought this mkz
2 overall: the best car i have ever owned
2 the hybrid lincoln mkz is fun to drive has good pick up speed and my current gas mileage is 341 mpg
2 it has nearly 5000 miles on it since we purchased it new in august 2012
2 i'd buy this car again without hesitation
2 i paid zero premium between the hybrid version and the gas version of the mkz
2 it is more stylish that the town car has an excellent turning radius very responsive and offers a quiet and fun driving experience
2 one of the best cars i have ever owned 14 so far
2 best car we've ever owned
2 when we replace our other car it will be with another lincoln hybrid
2 great warrenty !
2 i've had the car now 4 months and pretty much like everything about it other than the trunk size
2 i'm still increasing my mpg's but it's doing better than adve
2 would do it again
2 i'm quite happy we chose the american made luxury hybrid
2 the price diffrence probably won't be recovered in gas mileage over the gas model but we feel better about doing our small part in reducing emissions and being more efficient
2 i found this one and finally decided to get one
2 it is doing what i want it to do *s*
2 i wanted it for longer road trips
2 the 40 plus mpg and smooth ride have made mytwo 4000 miles to the east worth the purchase
2 with a fillup indicating 750 miles to empty it's great to just avoid going to the gas station
2 over all not bad car hard to see to side and rear but getting used to using the mirrows and backup camera warning sinsor are a nusance
2 my experience owning these vehicles has been very rewarding
2 i would say the styling v-8 power comfort safety features along with reliability of the tc probably driven 500000 miles----has been beyound my expectations
2 i love my lincoln town car and this is number four
2 at 6'6' i have much room
2 but i have made some changes
2 i took the regular air filter out and put in a k&n permanent air filter
2 i also use premium gas because i get much better performance
2 my experience owning these vehicles has been very rewarding
2 i would say the styling v-8 power comfort safety features along with reliability of the tc probably driven 500000 miles----has been beyound my expectations
2 i would gladly recommend this vehicle to other drivers
2 i love my lincoln town car and this is number four
2 at 6'6' i have much room
2 but i have made some changes
2 i took the regular air filter out and put in a k&n permanent air filter
2 with my 5 year old in the back seat i have a renewed enthusiasm for family outings
2 i bought the car a bit hastily after i fell in love with it and i have no regrets
2 i am still in awe of this machine
2 always makes me smile and my hands sweat a little ;- fast and fun
2 this is the most fun i ever had with a car
2 between my 2011 bentley and my maserati i always prefer to drive my maserati 100% recommend
2 love it would buy it again
2 best ever will buy again
2 the best car ever it's often mistaken for a limo
2 after driving with me to maine she fell in love with it
2 spend the extra and get the grand touring-it is well worth !
2 bought new for a great deal drives like a car room of a mid-size suv inside looks great true 32 mpg freeway with automatic
2 we wanted a vehicle with lots of room and good gas economy
2 this was a wonderful choice
2 never have been a big fan of suv's but this one turned me
2 a great little suv for the couple on the go or the small family
2 we just bought this suv a couple of weeks ago and so far it's been absolutely wonderful
2 not so pleased with this vehicle
2 i should have kept my prius
2 my fiance' fights with me over who's car this is i love the pushbutton start and keyless entry we got the sport awd version and so far are satified with it's performance on-road and in severe winter conditions
2 we purchased in sept of 2012 review i
2 i am very pleased over all a pretty vehicle very sporty looking
2 looks good just standing still and drives like a dream
2 i am 70 years old and this is the best suv or car i have !
2 you can't help but love to drive it
2 not too big not too small and totally fun to drive
2 great car test drive it and you will be sold
2 i own another mazda that i have had for over twenty years without any major repairs
2 i actually purchased the vehicle in march of 2012 but that choice wasn't available for this review
2 my daughter likes mine so much she bought one for herself
2 i find the driver seat uncomfortable- for a short person like me
2 i used to be a honda person but since i bought my 2008 maz
2 i really enjoy my 2014 mazda cx5
2 i like the blind spot monitor the tire gauge monitor
2 traded in a '11 ford escape limited awd for the '14 mazda cx-5 gt in sep 2013 so this is after 4 mo of use
2 happy with vehicle overall
2 it's the most impressed i've been with a new car in 12 years of buying them
2 the gt trim is well worth it and comfortable if you enjoy a sporty drive stiff springs
2 i ordered it a couple of days after test driving it's definitely the vehicle i want to be in for the next few years and the most fun suv i've ever driven
2 i would buy another one if i had to or recommend it to another potential buyer
2 shortly after we purchased our cx-5 i shared our positive experience with a colleague who was looking at comparable vehicles
2 suspension is the weakest part of an overall excellent automobile
2 outside of an mgb driven eons ago this is my first foreigncar and must say i am delighted with japanese technology and styling
2 would recommend and purchase this car again
2 so far we made the right choice but this coming winter will tell the whole story living in wisconsin's snow country
2 i look forward to going places in my terrific little car
2 and yes i bought the license plate !
2 great carbetter than the honda crv  i had
2 overall i do love this suv but starting to think something is wrong with the one i bought
2 our favorite vehicle in the past 20 !
2 you get your monies worth and then some
2 i have recommended the cx5 to my friend and family
2 mpg is exceptional with the 25 engine my cx-5 averages 30 city and 36 hway
2 overall very pleased with this purchase
2 we own our cars for a long time so researched carefully and believe this one will still be there ten years out
2 this is my first crossover and i love it
2 will definitely be buying another mazda when i need another car
2 still love the car after 3 months  have no problem so far with 3000 miles can't wait to drive on long trips and the price is great it's on clearance now so take advantage of it while you can 
2 owned less then 30 days taken one trip of 1000 miles loved it nice ride and low road noise
2 great vehicle got it at end of year deal for around 30700 before ttl etc 2012can't beat that for a grand touring package with bose option upgrade + moonroofgreat gas mileage as compared with other vehicles of this sizeabout 19-20 mpg on mixed 50
2 would not say i am unhappy with the car or regret buying it
2 its nice to approach the cx-9 press door button enter and start without removing keys from pocket
2 also enjoy feature to key press 2x and hold and have the front windows and sunroof open to get rid of that hot blast of air
2 i would buy another one if the 4 items i mentioned are addressed changed/added
2 gas milage is good for its size i rate it a 10 all around
2 this is my second cx9
2 very pleased have had it about a month
2 we are extremely happy with our purchase
2 every time i see one of its competitors on the road i shake my head and wonder why the driver didn't buy a mazda
2 mazda attitude about fixing this car is the worst
2 love the sprited green really turns heads
2 my wife drives this car more than her infiniti ex35
2 i would highly recommend this car to anyone looking for an inexpensive commuter that can double for traveling reasonable distances on vacation and carry plenty of stuff for shopping  good stereo good lights cruise control alloys  just needs more
2 of all the vehicles that i test drove i would buy this one again
2 i will never buy a mazda ever again
2 having owned this car for about 3 months now and 3500 miles i could not be happier with it
2 i purchased the i grand touring sedan
2 very happy with all the features
2 this is the best quality car for my need and ridethe highest torque is at a low engine rotation compared to other competitors of this c class carthose who are looking for c class cars should at least look at and feel it and test drivemazda is not like
2 great handling car  back seat & wind noise were my main problemsalesman were awesome & not pushy
2 2014 mazda3 is best summed up as a game changer
2 overall i enjoy driving it eventhough it's not that great driving on long trips
2 you need to go to rest stops every 25 hours just to stretch your legs
2 mileage is better than expexted i'm happy about that
2 i traded in a recent forester subaru again very sensible and plain yet the m5 is extremely fun and a great value for the dollar
2 mazda 5 has so many user-friendly features overlooked by many but build in as part of the overall concept of versatility and exceptional value
2 anyone who is in the market for a new sedan with a quality feel great looks class leading fuel economy and sporty handling should drive this car
2 in my one week of ownership over all i am pleased with the car intended functionsits fun to drive and it makes my driveway look sexier than ever beforei thoroughly checked out all the competition nissan honda toyota and this car was the only c
2 i come from driving toyotas all my life but have become a mazda believer
2 i test drove many cars before deciding to purchase this vehicle

2 i purchased the vehicle through true car best choice i could have made i saved over $2500 of msrp
2 car and driver name it the best car in its class over the honda accord ex and from my experince i agree
2 great car- you get a lot for your money
2 i use to buy mazda's all the time in the 80 and 90 but left when mazda teamed up with ford but i am back now
2 i would any day prefer a car which is comfortable to drive with all the featur
2 should cost over $10000 more but do not tell mazda
2 so good i cannot believe i do not see more on the rode
2 this is the best car i've ever had and i've had two bmws
2 i've had it for a month and driven it 1150 miles on both highways and nyc streets
2 i have the gt in soul red so it looks great and is fully loaded
2 compared to camry accord altima all of which i have driven this is a driver's car that is tight and fun to drive unlike the others
2 a lot of people come up to us and ask question on the car
2 i also love the gas mileages that i get
2 just with a few tweaks and it is a no brainer
2 the 2014 mazda 6 is the working man's exotic sports !
2 automatic trans works very well
2 mazda is has created a vehicle that provides best in market value along with a vehicle that is fun to drive
2 i am 100% satisfied
2 very simply amazing getting 325 mpg mostly around town wish it had a tad more zoom but understand that's a trade off for the 325 mpg
2 i chose the mazda 6 over the nissan altima and subaru legacy because it had and style and the features i liked best
2 the only fault i can find in the 2014 mazda 6 is that it is taking me a little time to adjust to the difference in power after owning a 2011 grand touring with the v6
2 i compared with camry accord and altima and decided to go with 6
2 i'm happy i made that decision
2 after several weeks of researching my next purchase it came down to the mazda 6 and the honda accord sport but in the end i ended up buying the mazda
2 very affordable reliable economical and overall value for price paid
2 i've owned 4 mazdas and each one just gets better and better
2 with the tech package you get everything you can wish for in a car for under $30k
2 lots of power but will remain calm and composed if driven as such
2 lots of fun to drive and commands respect on the road
2 i do recommend getting this if you want something cheap and quick its a great car to have as your 2nd car
2 its a solid car and really enjoyable to drive
2 great little hot hatch if you want performance for the money i would highly recommend this car and if you can swing it get one with the tech packagei love !

2 i bought the car new in 2009 and i have only approximately 15000 miles on it because it doesn't go on long trips
2 most fun i have had for a long time
2 mine is a 2009 and i bought it used

2 it's fun to drive and saves lots of money
2 i like it more now than when i bought it
2 great car and should last a long time

2 i believe i am driving the future of automobiles today
2 we purchased this vehicle at the high point dollar wise but it is an investment that will hopefully lead to lower pric
2 it must be experienced to understand completely how it changes the paradigms
2 this car is a game changer- you must get in one to appreciate how much better a car it is than all of the other cars on the road today
2 the car gets better over time as more features are added via software release
2 this car has to be driven to realize how game changing it truly is
2 until you drive one of these you have no idea what an electric car designed from the ground up can be
2 best car i've ever !
2 i am enjoying a new kind of ride
2 what a pleasure to drive past gas stations and help the environment too
2 oh it's also so fast and responsive so that driving is fun again
2 my other car is a 2006 prius which in comparison is real basic transportation
2 i'd like to be able to plug it into an electricity source that doesn't use fossil fuel
2 its my second vehicle so i can't comment on handling in snow or poor weather cond
2 i love the brz but not as a daily drive car
2 if you like the feeling of being on rails when you're negotiating a corner you have to drive this car

2 got the car for msrp
2 overall recommended for a sporty fun car to afford one many smiles that is affordable
2 not a speed demon but find the curves and corners and you can imagine yourself in a very high end car driving experience very easlily
2 i got out of my 2012 forester lease early to buy this vehicle and it's my 3rd forester
2 i traded up from a 2010 and don't regret it
2 our first subaru
2 test drove all the competition and the subaru blew them all away
2 the electronic power steering took a couple days to get used to but now i love it
2 i purchased by costco auto program
2 the basic interiors such as small glove box and door pockets could be improved
2 we almost bought an outback and are sorry we didn't sinceit's more roomy and a better value for th
2 love the subarus and this is my 3rd one
2 the outstanding bad spot is a big side pillar making left shoulder checks cumbersome and therefore dangerous
2 bot 25i premium i was surprised at the acceleration with cvt rear camera is good but screen could have been a little biggerride is very good and controlled
2 overally i would choose this vehicle again
2 the forester provides the best bang for your buck
2 lacking in cushioning thigh support and side bolsters to hold you in place while turning ?
2 great vehicle  wish the extra's  hitch  cargo cover etc
2 only time will tell if i become a subaru groupei
2 i researched like crazy before buying itand am very !
2 i settled on the subaru because i felt it provided the most features for the price & was the top choice of consumer reports for quality & safety review id:
2 owned many cars and suv's this could be the most fun suv i've driven
2 this lived up to our expectations
2 must have to go up to the snow
2 here in the midwest the awd comes in real handy snow rain freezing rain you never know what you'll get i ski bike and kayak the roof racks and storage are great
2 i use it as a city car in nyc and it fits that role perfectly
2 it handles great takes potholes like a champ
2 the visibility while driving is perfect and i feel like i can see everything that is going on aroun
2 a great car if you want a car that feels big and still gives you mpg and awd at a great price
2 overall this is a wonderful car for me as i drive it back and forth to work daily
2 i save on fuel costs with the fuel efficiency it offers and i don't have to worry about the weather conditions with the all-wheel drive
2 i can park it easily in the city i get the advertised 36 mpg on the highway where i spend much of my time
2 its great all around because with the awd you dont feel the lag from fwd cars when you accelerate
2 if it's not for the oil consumption i love this car
2 most fuel efficient and economical all wheel drivevehicle out there for a best buy !
2 does great in the snow
2 very pleased with this car
2 handling also improved and snow traction
2 the awd and safety features gives a very secure feeling when driving
2 excellent gas milage considering it has all wheel drive
2 at first i was not impressed with the car even though the interior was a good improvement over the previous generation subarus
2 with plenty of hp awd brembo brakes and tuned sport suspension it's a real performer
2 seriously consider this car for the 25-30k rangegreat feel easy to drive great performance when you need it in awd
2 its rally heritage can be felt and it gives the driver a raw and exciting feeling of a true drivers car
2 to get this feel usually requires paying much more
2 i think i will injoy this car for years to come
2 love this car can't ever imaging owning anything but a subaru
2 get this car cant beat the value for the price and the gas milage
2 overall i'm very happy with the legacy
2 time will tell how trouble free it is but subaru does have a good reputation
2 will buy the same brand
2 love this car i don't why i never looked seriously at a subaru before
2 this vehicle is the best value i have owned and that includes hondas cadillacs audis acuras and infinitis
2 if you are not in a hurry and want a solid wagon with awd a decent cargo area and nice build quality
2 after months of test-driving and researching - we bought the outback and could not be happier
2 the outback rides nice handles like a car in traffic but has ground clearance and interior space of a crossover or suv
2 overall this is the best outback i've owned
2 it rides well on long trips and can carry a lot of stuff
2 i can not wait for the first snowfall
2 good vehicle but needs some tuning to be perfect
2 probably one of the best vehicles we have ever owned
2 consumer reports states subaru is 2nd best and we can deifnitely see it in our !
2 couldn't be more pleased
2 i've owned two subarus and love the cars and the brand
2 i am totally satisfied with this outback i purchased it in dover delaware  from a winner dealer !
2 i live at the beach but have not made the opportunity to check out the 4 wheel drive feature on the sand
2 waste of time regretted within hours should have stayed with chevy or tried ford
2 i'd buy it again
2 i had considered a toyota & honda models with this vehicle and the valve of not paying extra for all wheel drive and the excellent reviews by the automotive editorials sold me
2 love this car our first suv and i only wish that i had gotten one before but am happy with this one
2 this is my first subaru ever after 20 years of toyotas so the bar is set pretty high
2 i can live with the dislikes i mentioned above as all cars have their quirks and i am more interested in long term reliability
2 i bought the outback because of the aw
2 the biggest complaint is that it is impossible to fit
2 i have owned this car since mid-december 2012 and have put ~2000 miles on it driving in rain snow mud streams cold weather and a few days of temperate weather
2 the car has delivered on all expectations
2 if you're really concerned about the lack of unneeded horsepower i would wait for '14 - perhaps subaru will add a v6 or 4-cyl turbo option
2 fell safe in it great looking crossover !
2 wish it drove a bit quieter and was a bit quicker merging into highway traffic but the tradeoff is great mpg and if those are the biggest complaints i think it's a !
2 handles extremly well in all weather conditions including snow easy to drive and park both in urban/forest environment
2 the luggage room is enough for most of the family trips
2 great roomy interior with very good seating
2 we love this vehicle so farour first awdand it has avery short turning radius and the ride is food for a small suv
2 regardless of the few flaws  i absolutely love !
2 i have no regrets i actually can't wait for this winter to drive it and know i'll be safe and able to get down our unplowed roads with ease
2 i also drive a jeep and a ridgeline and they serve a different purpose and are fun vehicles also but this is my little gas sipper a
2 wound up buying a limited due to very limited availability after hurricane sandy don't really feel leather climate control or upgraded radio is necessary for my taste anyway
2 also had idle issues with the car and got a new engine control module inst
2 very disappointing car for the price paid
2 very pleased with my first subaru
2 i am very pleased with this car so far
2 i consistently get around 30 mpg and have gotten 34
2 i put some bikes on the back and that acted like a parachute so i only got 25 mpg that time
2 we've only had the crosstrek for a few weeks and it is awesome
2 it is fun to drive has enough power to do what's needed
2 before we purchased we looked at many compact crossovers and to get awd with the features of the crosstrek would cost $1000's more
2 i've owned this car for about three months and put around 2500 miles on it
2 i bought it just as winter ended so i haven't gotten to test it out in the snow yet
2 in heavy rain it handled excellent
2 this is my second subie so far my wife and i like this vehicle no major complaints  we love subaru very dependable ridesbest manufacture of vehicles  number one in consumer reportiihs top safety pick
2 does everything i want
2 this is the vehicle i wanted from the start of my vehicle search but would have been a little happier if i could have paid a little less
2 the dealership here in louisville is fantastic
2 dont promise what they don't deliver and very organized
2 the rides a little bumpier so if you have a bad back it might not be the best thing for you
2 the car isn't particularly fast at least with a launch but it feels fast
2 i can definitely go adventuring
2 great truck for the part-time person who hauls things around  very stylish looks great on the rode
2 definitely the best value out there for the moneybelieve me i took my time on this purchasenot happy that other brands want to give you a 36 months warranty andthen sell you a $260000 extended warranty
2 good value for money no major problems good off-road handling
2 reliable excellent mileage for a truck and would buy again
2 this is my 2nd unit
2 first one was a 97 which i still drive
2 the second one is a 2008 which i bought used 3 years ago
2 would not buy this kind of car !
2 my wife and i love this car and i expect to see them more and more on the road
2 this car truly feels like a high-end german car in that everything works together and makes you feel connected to the car
2 its steering is tight and communicative its handling is razor-sharp and its overall feel is positive
2 the same people probably don't know how to manipulate the cvt ! folks just know how to floor it  ?
2 you can't buy this car anymore but if you can find a good used one it's a unbelievable value
2 i'm a huge fan off the size style sportiness and comfort
2 shame on suzuki for not knowing how to market a great car
2 great car not only for the money
2 great car get one before they are all gone
2 i was taking 35 mile per hour curves at about 60 and never had a second thought
2 it has a feel of a much more expensive auto from the soft interior touch spots to the way it handles and drives
2 i bought mine from a dealership with a chrysler connection
2 the dealership promised that parts should be available
2 race to a suzuki dealer to get one before they're gone for good
2 i will take extremely good car of this a one of a kind automobile
2 besides i'll be spending a fortune on tires if something isn't corrected its a great little car

2 i have owned car for 1 year and it has been a very capable performer
2 suzuki's best kept secret that needs to be revealed to all ;
2 i bought this new in 2007 but this website is making me choose between 2011 & 2012
2 sold it in less than a year for awd used matrix a better all around value
2 i have the 6 speed model which gives descent pickup for a four wheel drive vehicle
2 this was the best car i have ever own - sadly some punk decided to pull out in front of me and creamed my car which by the way i walked away from so the safety measures are as-like a volvo
2 i own 2-sx4 crossover premiums and both perform well and recently tested performance in snow a+awd is best with nominal mpg loss 36 miles a tank full
2 i get 254 city my wife 24 city pretty good when you consider it's an awd

2 had a vibe and loved it
2 great value for the $ awd great in the snow253 mpg in awd modeaudio system great superior braking and handling
2 i own 2 sx4 crossovers and both perform well
2 also you'll sacrifice some trunk room-but the seats do fold down for extra space
2 if you want to get more than you paid for this is the car
2 i'd buy again if i didn't step up to the kizashi
2 pretty darn good car for the price so far
2 this is a small car and when buying a car like this don't expect a big car space or total comfort
2 great vehicle if you live in snowy climates easy to get in and out of and a great fun !

2 have not had a single problem
2 this car is fun to drive and has a great interior

2 and this has plenty of room for me
2 has plenty of power at all speeds and manuevers like a rally car
2 overall this is a really solid feeling truck with ample room to take the whole family camping or to the lake well still providing relatively good gas mileage for a larger suv
2 i refer to it as a truck because behind the wheel this is really what it feel
2 i traded in a chevy 3/4 ton diesel for this 4runner after we sold our fifth wheel
2 the toyota is easy to drive park and fits in the garage
2 overall i'm really happy with all aspects of this vehicle
2 i perfer to drive it over my mb gl450
2 several 4runner's has been in my family since the late 80's and those trucks lasted for years with alot of miles to show for great service
2 great truck that really holds its value parts are abundant and reasonable price
2 in addition very cheap to maintain runs off unleaded gasoline
2 excellent vehicle for off road use or on road touring
2 lots of people notice and get questions wow what is ?
2 we have a 1992 camry xle with 150000 miles never misses a beat
2 keep in mind that i use my 4runner for boat hauling fly fishing adventures snowy ski trips and downtown business meetings
2 so far best suv i have !
2 slow acceleration at low speeds picks up at higher speeds
2 turns have to be negotiated slowly unless you like that falling-of-the-seat sensation
2 the explorer and jeep were incredible vehicles but i wanted a true truck to handle anything i can throw at it
2 great suv still body on frame so it will do what others would like to be able to do and still do it in style
2 fantastic ride with a comfortable interior
2 i don't know where you'd find a better car in the low $30k price range
2 my next car will definitely be from a different company
2 if i had to make a new car decision again i would still opt for the avalon
2 if you get the limited model make sure you take your smart phone in the car and play something via bluetooth on the stereo or bring in a cd that you know has a song with low bass sounds and test your stereo with some volume
2 i would definitely buy another
2 this is a super smooth comfortable fast luxury sedan without the luxury price tag
2 this is my third toyota and they have not disappointed me !
2 best automobile we have purchased in 30 years
2 we researched and shopped for 3 months before purchasing
2 in our opinion this was by far the best value in it's class without breaking t

2 love our car
2 love how it handles the road
2 it feels like a strong smooth and high quality car
2 a great car i love it and enjoy the driving experience
2 as of yet i have not seen another on the road
2 it corners excellently and practically drives its self
2 we traded in our 2007 avalon limited for this updated model and simply love itthe v6 had way more get up and go than the hybrid duh and we liked that so we'll just pay gas for that 'feature'styling is a bit blah compared to other cars but we're ok
2 we love the car and actually purchased it over a lexus es 350 and mercedes e-350 which left our pocket book $20k + richerthe technology built into the car is overwhelming
2 the car comes with several well documented manuals for the owner
2 this is my second avalon
2 my experience with the 2013 would cause me to get another one
2 i had a 2008 love it !
2 this car gets lots of attention and honk
2 39-40 mpg will improve our economy 30% over 06 avalon and we were pleased with that as other cars than made 25
2 99 having owned and or driven every luxury car made in us over the last 40 years along wityh top of the line mercedes bmwand jagi consider this to be the finest auto made
2 a fantastic car to own and drive
2 i honestly don't know why the toyota avalon hybrid is not on more top ten lists for fuel efficient vehicles
2 previously i've owned a bmw
2 best vehicle i ever owned
2 i purchased one for my wife on a recent weekenc and liked it so much i went back and leased another for
2 highly recommend - beautiful ride
2 for this car purchase i only considered hybrid cars
2 i wanted something with great mpg but was also well-appointed
2 i'm getting about 41 mpg about 50/50 split between highway and city
2 a quality touring sedan that's a pleasure to drive with outstanding gas mileage in hybrid trim
2 would do it again but maybe xle just for the seating but all the extras were not worth the $$ for us
2 always get 40 to 42 mpg as calculated by me and not the automatic system
2 so far no rattles in 1 year usage 11000 miles
2 very comfortable driving
2 comfy comfy ride for passengers
2 before the camry i owned the 2008 prius and the take-off power with the camry is significantly better and feels equivalent to my v8 dodge ram truck
2 also the transition from engine to electric only is a lot smoother than the prius barely noticeable and
2 just a sweet vehicle i got an xle hybrid with all the options
2 at this point i'm getting 40-41 mpg--unbelievable for a car this powerful
2 has great interior and feature-packed dash
2 overall excellent value for the money best overall hybrid vehicle after doing months of research
2 this is a great car with remarkable pick-up for a hybrid
2 just a great economical family car that does everything well and gets great mileage
2 i love my corolla !

2 it is great to drive and i feel so safe in it
2 i really think it's the best one yet
2 great power for lane changes unlike the 13 which i did also own it will def get you out of a spot
2 gas is amazing i can drive and drive and the needle won't move
2 work in city and live in suburbs never a complaint on gas mileage power style reliability
2 this 2014 drives nothing like the 2013 corolla

2 all in all i am very pleased with this
2 i am very pleased with this car
2 it has all of the features i was searching for and more
2 the built in camera and blue tooth is very convenient

2 best car i ever owned
2 you won't be sorry
2 solid capable feel - feels like a tank that can do anything and go anywhere
2 can't wait to go camping in it
2 i bought the manual transmission and was kind of disappointed in the 12 mpg i got
2 while it was fun to drive i'd recommend the auto if you buy one
2 the only time the gas mileage changed was when we pulled a 2700 lb featherlight camper trailer and we ac
2 i just got mine and loving every minute of !

2 owing a fj is a blast and you can take them anywhere
2 off road - the fj starts drooling at the idea of going off roadmud - the fj slurps mud and spits it out with ease
2 you pay for the name lexus yes some of the features are a little plusher on the lexus but it isn't worth the cost
2 if you want a reliable and luxurious suv under 40k this is a good place to start

2 i have owned 3 new priuses and had very good fuel mileage with my 2010 and 2011 prius
2 my new 2013 prius does not do very good on fuel mileage especially on the road
2 i have close to 7000 miles on it and i think it should be doing much better

2 owned too many cars to mention but the prius is one of my favorites just under the
2 after having owned the cmax for 10 months and 15k miles i traded it in for this prius
2 my goal was to get a gas sipper that had a good safety rating
2 so i traded for the prius
2 and i'm glad i did
2 after 2 years and 60k miles - we made the best choice - saved so much $$$ - both prius' we own are fantastic not one repair or maint issue after all these miles - i expect to get 300000 miles on these cars
2 i am still smiling and enjoying the ride even knowing that i am driving to work
2 love the smart key and door touch locking
2 so far all of our experience with this prius have been positive
2 just took a trip and it was smooth sailing gas mileage is in the high 40 s best i've ever had
2 i got 56 mpg at 65 mph for 200 miles & 53 mpg at 70 mph coming back
2 i bought one the next weekthis car is designed fo
2 the hatchback and rear seat fold down to produce a massive amount of storage capacity
2 the technology in the car is amazing
2 with a regular plug in it takes only 3 hours to rechar
2 well worth the money if nothing else in the gas savings alone
2 exactly what i was looking for better than i !
2 overall i am very pleased and am already planning for my next one
2 would/will buy again when this one is no longer driveable
2 i have owned toyota vehicles since 1997 and have always been satisfied
2 best and most efficient vehicle i have ever had
2 i love my new !
2 first car i have owned that del
2 what the manufactory promised and i have owned a lot of cars
2 the only regret is not buying 10 years ago
2 i have owned the prius package 2/ii 2005 2008 2011 and now the persona 2013 black cherry is awsome
2 the 2013 is by far a superior product although i miss my 2005 for other reasons
2 previous to owning a prius i owned a 199
2 i have owned my prius iii for just over 1000 miles which is hardly enough time to give an extensive review but enough to give a fair first impression
2 this is my second prius the first one i drove for 7 years with no problems
2 i bought the new one fully loaded and haven't regreted my decision for a moment
2 it drives excellant it is a good car to own
2 i have owned a few small car and this is the best one of all  53 to 55 mpg to and from work 
2 twenty-five hundred kilometers on it so far and i am still over the moon
2 averaging 60 miles to the imperial gallon nimble in town and great legs on the highway
2 i purchased this vehicle with a very specific purpose in mind and it has been exactly what i needed it to be
2 i drive roughly 100 miles per day and make a 500+ mile trip once a month or solots of miles and it's usually just m
2 first new car and it was such a wise choice
2 it may not be the sportiest or fastest car in town but it is fun to drive has great mileage and has extended service life
2 wish they hadn't gone cheap with some of the stuff normally considered standard now
2 its some of the most bang for the buck you can get for a full hybrid vehicle that can do electric-only driving below 30-40 mph f
2 i would definitely buy another one
2 it drives like a luxury vehicle - very smooth handling on the road
2 i bought this vehicle because i wanted a small wagon that got good gas mileage with ample cargo space to haul all of our stuff to our vacation home in the summer
2 the car rides well and gets excellent gas mileage and the bells and whistles associated with the audio bluetooth and built-in gps are wonderful - easy to set-up and easy to use
2 bought one of the first prius v producedwas anxiously waiting for it
2 overall i love the vehicle and have recommended it to many people
2 it can be somewhat confusing to go between my wife's camry hybrid and the prius with the different gear shifts
2 this is a great car if you can get over the weak engine struggling when you need to accelerate for highway or city driving
2 owned for 2 weeks
2 he sat in the seat behind me i'm '6 and didn't complain at all
2 i like this car - have had it a little over a year without any problems
2 drove it from texas to virginia and back with 2 adults 1 child and 2 dogs and was comfortable and roomy
2 don't miss stopping for gas every 4 or 5 !
2 excellent car great mpg's lots of cargo room give it a 10 in spite of the flaws
2 i just recomimend it for someone who wants reliableble transportationi
2 i'm really happy with this vehicle would recommend it over all the similar station wagon type cars i looked at
2 driving a hybrid turned out to be easy love the gas savings too

2 driving a hybrid turned out to be easy love the gas savings too
2 when we looked at all the details- it was the quality that sold us on the rav
2 frankly i felt like i was riding a hearse yet alone an suv
2 i have an original version from the 1990's and closing in on 500000 miles with only
2 have only had this car for two weeks so far but love it in mostly every respect
2 had a 2010 rav4 sport-really liked the car but ride was too stiff with sport suspension and run flat tires
2 my new xle rides smmoth seats are more comfortable and interior is upgraded
2 styling dash controls the power of the engine and the options are great well satisfied
2 overall its' a nice ride things can be changed or upgraded its' a first year model remake so they can work out the bugs
2 hopefully this will last me for a long time
2 the right size for a small active family
2 very disappointed in toyota quality on this rav4
2 im not totally satisfied with this car
2 i had this as a rental while my 2012 escape was being looked at not fixed just looked at for the 3rd time i fell in love with it
2 i never did want to get a crossover but my wife did and she deserves what she wants
2 very fun car to drive the 25l had more getup-n-go then i expected
2 also the dealer experience was very pleasant
2 drives and handles well nicely styled and sporty has great space and controls with good gas mileage
2 styling dash controls the power of the engine and the options are great well satisfied
2 the new rav4 has improved in seating comfort and driving position but acceleration is just adequate with eco mode off and downright slow with it on
2 based on what i've experienced in my newer 2013 model i am pleased with the vehicle but am waiting for the inevitable dee
2 so very glad i bought !
2 *i love mine after 1 full month very happy i bought !
2 great to own fun to drive
2 overall very happy after 3000 miles
2 mpg could always be better but im getting a solid 28 on the highway
2 it takes some time to get used to the 4 cylinder power - but in reality its quite peppy due to the gearing
2 the ride is a bit choppy but chock thi
2 if you are looking for something bigger than a car but not as big as an suv
2 nice style toyota quality for the most part but just feels overall cheaper then previous models not as solid
2 we are very happy with it
2 i am a very happy !
2 great bang for the buck i almost bought a subaru and hadn't even considered the rav4
2 i have the 2013 toyota rav4 limited
2 will never go back to a sedan !
2 the rav has a lot of pep and handles beautifully on !
2 the rav4 eliminates the concern by offering a hand lever instead much better no reason to consider the hond
2 love the looks and handling
2 overall i am very pleased with the rav 4
2 i previously owned a 2004 rav4 and never had any trouble out of it
2 has all i need for lifestyle driving both in-town and on the road
2 the sienna was not lacking in power and it handles as you would expect a minivan to
2 i have owned minivans since they first came into the marketing must say we have come a long ways from when it started
2 bought my first tacoma aug 2013 last week received recall notice informing me that the top of the engine has to be ripped off to replace all the valve springs
2 the things that i find wrong with this vehicle can be fixed and seem to be minor
2 the overall ride and handling are great and true to the toyota name
2 i'm in the process of getting some of the cons fixedi hope anyway
2 i purchased the tacoma double cab with trd off-road pkg for $430 below invoice
2 that said this truck is great even with the cons noted
2 i still bought the tacoma
2 yes preferred the nissan ride more
2 i got the trd sports package and love the way it looks
2 i wanted a fuel sipping truck that could still tow carry and be reliable for a long time and i feel i hit the nail on the !
2 very satisfying vehicle for my use except for not having intermittent wipers
2 trip toggling the switch constantly to clear small amounts of rain
2 best truck i have ever owned !
2 great truck looks good drives good and will last forever
2 i personally couldn't be more pleased with my new truck
2 this vehicle is truely worth the !
2 lots of features that others don't have but the ones that it does have could have been improved to keep customer in mind
2 and has been proven to be very reliable i would choosea tacoma
2 i like this vehicle very much it takes time to get use to the size of it
2 even though i got screwed on the car trade which we all do i would highly recommend this vehicle
2 best truck i've ever ownedso long !
2 if you want a truck that's got all the bells and whistles is realiable gets good fuel economy and can still tow a fair amount this is the truck for you
2 traded my 2005 tacoma double cab 4x4 long bed sr5 i bought brand new off the lot in oct 2005 for a 2013 tacoma double cab 4x4 long bed trd sport brand new off the lot in feb 2013reason my opinions why i gave the following categories a score of 10styl
2 one word - best !
2 great truck tows my implement trailer lawnmowers like theres nothing there
2 great truck for the money traded in a 2011 scion tc which i bought new as well and it was the best idea i have had

2 great syle great milage good off road handling a
2 traded in my 2011 scion tc for this truck and has a 10x smoother ride than the tc
2 overall i simply can't reccomend this truck the value is just not there
2 my dealership replaced both air induction pumps free of charge of course but rushed me in and out like i was part of some covert operationwhich i guess i was
2 i would dare to say this is the best 4x4 on the road period
2 the big three need to take notice as this truck will out perform them
2 this is my second tundra and after reviewing all the trucks in this segment th
2 love my tundra i traded a 2012 tundra 46 4x2 for it only lost about 1 mpg
2 the 57 i have now is much more powerful
2 awesome buy would recommend to !
2 even though the truck is a bit outdated build quality makes up for its short coming
2 i'm pleased; no government motors in my near !
2 if you are looking to buy a truck do yourself a favor and take a look at the tundra
2 be prepared for a firm ridecorners well handles like cars that have a much lower stance
2 i believe this is a very good vehicle for someone who needs the versatility of an suv without sacrificing the gas milage and handling of a larger vehicle
2 for me it has exceeded my expectations
2 i test drove many cars cross-overs and suvs before i settled on my venza 10 months ago
2 given what i paid for it and the subsequent low cost to own this car insurance registration fuel costs etc
2 i am so glad i purchased it
2 i would do it all over
2 for the price i paid and what i got for my money i could not be happier
2 my insurance is very reasonable
2 toyota's 24-month maintenance free program is great; something i never got from ford or gm
2 my lease is only 10 months old and i am looking to find another car to trade because it is so unsafe
2 the styling cavernous interior cargo with seats folding flat at the flip of a lever excellent gas mileage for it's size i4-awd and toyota reliability won me over in spite of this one major downsidei wish i could have gotten the sunroof !
2 i would definetly buy another
2 dealer service has been excellent; five star
2 i would definetly buy another
2 it is a great looking great riding wagon that flies in the face of the station wagons of yore

2 first european purchase and i'm glad i did
2 great value for what i was looking for in a cari have put over 30000 miles on my cc and still enjoy it as much as day one

2 if you want a practical yet exhilarating driving experience without the boy racer cheapness that a lot of cars have these days than this car is the one for you
2 i own the 4-door autobahn
2 i have owned other vws in the past but in 2013 vw has greatly improved the quality of the gti inside and out
2 the car is a joy to drive at any speed and with an average mpg of 34 mpg i am a very happy owner
2 i bought a 2010 gti with 13000 mi
2 it is a great car for someone who wants a smaller practical hatchback that performs very well gets 32mpg on the highway and has an interior that embarrasses many $35-45000 cars
2 such a joy to drive without the hassle of always having to shift in traffic
2 i'm very happy with my gti
2 i have no complaints none at all
2 ive owned a 2010 manual and loved it the only problem in 30k miles was a faulty tire pressure sensor

2 also owned three passat's as well
2 best vehicle i have ever !

2 as long a diesel prices stay steady and available atmore places this is the way to go
2 overall i'm really happy with the car
2 terrific vehicle for commuting & long 500+ mile per day trips

2 the radio with xm was really nice and the room in the car cannot be !
2 quiet the driving experience and vw will have a solid 10
2 overall i would recommend this car over a honda/nissan/toyota but maybe not over a gm/ford/chrysler

2 i miss the power at times but enjoy driving
