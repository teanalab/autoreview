391	Overall it is a great car.
396	I like it and would buy another one.
401	We have the SLE model and for the price other cars did not compare.
402	We looked at Ford Escape, Honda CRV, Chevy Equinox and other small/midsize SUV's and none compared to what you get with the GMC Terrain.
407	This one looks like a 'keeper'!

737	Hard to believe its a Honda and not a Lexus.
742	Great handling, blue-tooth, back-up camera leather wraped steering wheel189 hp...
747	Best Accord ever.
748	We've been buying Honda's and Acura's since the late 1980's and this is the best Accord yet.
753	This is my first new car and I absolutely love it.
755	The stock rims are fantastic I have the black on black Sport trim.
756	The car is fire.
757	The gas mileage is unbelievable for the amount of horsepower you get.
763	It is just the best midsize car around for daily driving, long term ownership, value, all that good stuff is here.
768	Overall I would give it a 9.5 out of 10.
773	Superior to my last Accord, 2011 SE.
778	Excellent, reliable and technologically advanced transportation.
784	Glad I got the I4 with a timing chain (never change a $1000 timing belt), 40-46mpg, and power needed to get out of traffic in a hurry.
794	This car fits our needs like a glove, yet is great lookingj, sporty and fun to drive.
795	I am 6'-2and am comfortable riding in the back - so with one seven year old son, this car will meet our needs for a long time.
796	And it is considerably less expensive t
801	The Honda accord V6 sedan EX-L's or (touring edition) offers high-end luxury and performance at a great price.
802	After looking at all the competition (including Acura), the Accord offered the best overall value.
807	You can not beat the resale value of this mid sized sedan.
808	People know Honda's reputation for reliability and it pays wen when it is time to trade cars.
813	I LOVE THIS CAR.
814	IT'S SMART AND AFFORDABLE WITH LOTS OF COOL, 'USEFULL', TECHNOLOGIES.
815	COLOR SELECTION IS DECENT AND ITS RESALE IS VERY GOOD.
820	wonderful car for the size-just as nice, if not nicer, than its competitors
825	Just purchased the 2013 Honda Civic LX auto and absolutely love it.
826	After looking at its usual competitors, I couldn't find another that had the looks, handling, refinement and value found in the Civic.
827	For under $20k, you get a rear-view camera, bluetoo
832	This car has improved greatly!
833	I use it as a commuter car and I love it.
838	An outstanding car.
840	The interior has a vastly superior feel than the base model.
845	Excellent gas mileage, beautiful exterior and interior updates, excellent handling and standard features.
846	This vehicle is a great value and very fun to drive.
847	With Honda's reputation for quality and resale value you can't go wrong with the 2013 Civic.
853	I just went from a 2010 Civic DX L to a 2013 Civic LX and I have to confess that I am surprised by all the new standard additions made to these cars.
854	The 2013 is physically more attractive in my opinion.
860	Love it!
865	Car buyers should at least consider this car.
866	After all they have the reputation of strong and efficient car.
872	The Prius gets 50 mpg in city - and comes with all the features of the Civic EXL except for the backup camera.
879	With all you get, I think that this Honda is the best value no matter how rich or poor you are.
884	This is the first car I have ever owned that does not feel like i paid too much for, it has everything i need and then some at the right price.
889	I would definitely recommend this car to anyone looking at a small car.
890	The redesigned Civics for 2013 are probably the best small cars on the market.
891	Even the base LX model is on par with what other small cars have on mid and upper trim levels.
897	I just had this car for a week, and I am happy I chose it over the Prius C, which I had also considered.
899	Visibility is great all around.
905	Simple.
906	Great car for it's price and a proven platform.
911	great, excellent
921	Styling: I love the new styling which resembles the 2013 Accord.
922	The chrome adds elegance and sophistication.
923	It is no longer the cheap looking econobox of the past.Engine: 1.8 Liter 4-cylinder with 140hp which means it has to work harder when passing an

950	Great car!
951	Everything you need from a car
956	My review of the Honda Civic EX-L would be a 9.7 out of 10.0.
957	Absolutely wonderful vehicle.
967	This is a great every day car because of the gas efficiency, its interior comfort, and all the accessories necessary for every day life.
972	I think the consumer reports score is way too low..It must be for the 2012 not the 2013....For the money not much out there to beat in with style , performance, tech, and mileage.....
977	I love this car.
978	The power is just right for its size and I am comfortable in the interior, I don't feel cramped.
985	The car goes all over the place at highway speed and needs alot of correction.
991	I would recommend the civic if someone is interested in getting a lot of car for a decent price.
1001	Love it!
1006	Buy it and relax and enjoy a great ride..

1101	We really like our 2013 CT.
1102	It is well made, comfortable driving (especially on long road trips), We get a number of people noticing the vehicle and make favorable comments.

1299	I really like this car
1304	very stylish,easy to drive
1310	But we were pleasantly surprised that our CR-V actually gets better mileage than our Accord..
1320	I love driving again!!!
1321	The price was great, the gas mileage is better than most.
1322	I would recommend this SUV to others and family members.
1323	Great Job Honda!!
1329	This is my 5th Honda after 3 Civics and a Pilot EX-L AWD.
1331	I am getting 25+ mpg in the CR-V in a blend of stop-and-go and highway driving, which is good for an AWD vehicle.
1337	Is excellent for running around town and short trips down the interstate.

1406	It's great to drive.
1407	Handles great on wet roads.
1412	I'm so happy I bought the CRZ in February.
1413	It's one amazing looking car that's oh-so-fun to drive.

1415	After 6000 miles, the fuel economy remains much bett
1420	9 out of 10
1425	The ability to think like that is always a joy to behlod
1431	Honda truly made a vehicle in its own category: it's like a jeep, a truck and a van all in one.
1432	The Element is perfect for my active lifestyle.
1433	It is easy to park and has a small turning radius.
1441	I think the Element is best so far.
1442	I don't have to twist my back up for access.
1443	I love the design.
1444	Very roomy interior.
1445	It will last many years as Honda's do.

1463	Very reliable.
1464	It feels safe, but it does have a high profile.Overall, a good buy.
1465	They evidently last a long time as well.
1470	If you take a serious look at the way you drive and you find that your real needs are multi purpose, functional and reliabilty, then the Element should be considered.
1477	People have frequently asked me how I like my car and I probably bore them to tears extolling the virtues of the Honda Element.
1478	I have put very little money into this car other than the normal wear and tear type things.
1488	A great vehicle for carrying anything from a TV to dogs
1493	ALL GREAT FEATURES
1503	A car I would recommend highly...lot's of interior space...good mpg....attractive design in the sport package...car is a lot of fun to drive and has all the features I needed for a commuter car and it's peace of mind because it's a Honda.

1618	Good purchase and like the great mileage with a great ride.
1623	very nice,
1628	Overall, I'm very happy with the Honda.
1629	Honda quality, innovation, and ingenuity is there.
1630	It's safe and feels stable in adverse conditions.
1637	But, what it lacks in looks, it more than makes up for in personality and quality.
1644	I would recommend this truck to everyone I know because of the smooth ride and storage.
1650	If you are looking for a truck and you do not need a huge bed, look at the Ridgeline.
1651	My truck fits my needs like a glove.
1653	My truck goes through snow like a knife through hot butter.
1659	love it I have owned 2 of them and will buy a third
1664	Love it!
1665	Nice going into the dealership and not having high pressure sales.
1667	And it was a fair price!
1673	There is much more to like than dislike.
1674	It is a very handy truck for a person who occasionally hauls and tows but likes the feel and riding position of a truck.
1675	It isn't so big you can't park it, but not so small you can't haul anything.
1682	Added Front & Rear Honda splashguards prior to delivery.
1698	YES, i WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TRUCK TO EVERYONE!
1699	KEEP UP MAINTANCES, AND ITLL BE A GREAT TRUCK, FOR YEARS.
1705	Loved the way the Regal drove, but liked the Azera best of the three.
1706	Dealer gave me a great deal on my tradein.
1707	For the money, this is a great car ( so far).
1717	Hyundai has changed the game with this machine.
1719	We are the furture and Hyundai can be the leader in this lucrative market.
1726	Overall we are very satisfied with the Azera and would probably buy it again.
1731	The car has beautiful lines and style.
1732	Nice job Hyundai.
1737	Excellent

1782	An excellent vehicle.
1783	Better than the Lexus ES I traded in and $10,000 cheaper than a new Lexus ES.Incredibly spacious.
1789	I thought my Sonata was a great car, but the Azera goes way beyond it in offering a quiet, luxurious ride; beautiful, head-turning styling; and an incredible array of tech gadgets and gizmos that I marvel at every time I use them.
1795	This is my third Azera, from 2008 to 2010 until now a 2012.
1796	I am so impressed with this car that I bragged about it at the 2013 Philly Auto show also there is not enough room given here to go into detail about my satisfying experience with Azera.
1802	The car is little more pricey than before, but it is still a best buy for the money and compares very favorably with Lexus, MB and Audi for much less $
1807	Rides great, looks amazing.
1808	Finally a V6 that gets just about 30 mpg.
1809	I'm impressed.
1810	The LED lights are fantastic as well as the panoramic roof, cooled and heated seats.
1811	Blue Link is amazing.

1826	The more she drives it the better she likes it.

1842	well made
1847	Great purchase for the money.
1848	NAV, heated front & rear seats, leather and everything a person could want at a great price!
1853	Overall opinion, I would recommend this car to anyone looking for an alternative to the aging Maxima, the base model ES350, Honda Accord, or Toyota Avalon.
1854	The value to me was with all of the options, this car is LESS money than ALL of the competitors wi
1859	Hands down best car I have ever owned.
1861	This is a great car.
1867	The Azera is full sized stylish car that is quiet, smooth ridding, and very comfortable; whether it's short trips around town or on an extended road trip.

1880	Hyundai is building solid reliable quality cars

1892	Best large car out there, and at a reasonable price with great warranty.
1893	Buy this car!

1903	For the price, dependability and features, this car exceeds all of my expectations!
1908	I have owned many cars in the last 40 years but this is the best automobile ever.
1909	I had to put it in the garage as it is so fun to drive.
1910	Many people see it out and about and want to know what it is as the Azera is not seen on the road very much.
1916	Great car at a great price, best value for the dollar.
1917	Handles a little like a sports sedan.
1928	Best value for the money.
1929	Almost everything comes standard.

1940	Great price for the features,great warranty.
1947	Awesome little car

2000	overall i would say hyundai is fast becoming the auto of choice based on how many i see now and the reviews the company is receiving.
2002	right now, it's a  no-brainer...
2007	I travel mostly highway miles, a commuter car, so its puuurfect for me; and after a two and half months of ownership, who needs a elantra or a sonata?
2017	Overall I'd rate it a 9.
2022	I have had my 2012 Accent since July 2011, no problems and it rides well.In the winter traction is sometimes a problem....but usually when other cars also have the same problems
2027	Excellent
2032	Don't hesitate to drop in on your Hyundai dealer.

2179	Excellent car ....best value in smaller cars .
2180	I also have a Sonata Limited and this car is equally fun to drive for a lot less cost.

3927	could not be happier with the features and performance for the money as long as the car over time does not develope problems caused by cost cutting assembly and design flaws.
3937	Hyundai Santa fe is a Family Crossover, sporty look, very nice design and fun to drive.

4708	I am very happy with it.
4713	My wife has 2011 Tucson Limited AWD and loves it and I wanted something higher than my previous Elantra; so I bought a FWD GLS as our second vehicle.

5187	The Veracruz is worth considering if you are looking at the Lexus RX350.

5455	Best car I have ever owned ...
5460	For a near luxury vehicle, I would choose this vehicle over the Audi due to the fact that my previous Audis was unreliable with the electrical (many in fact) issues and very expensive maintenance.

5606	The car drives beautifully and it's packed with features, bells and whistles.
5607	I love having a hybrid with this much horsepower.
5613	Having owned Infiniti vehicles in the past, the Q50 is NOTHING like anything they have built before!
5620	I am very happy with the Q50 Sport Hybrid.
5621	It's very fast and satisfying everytime I drove it.In term of performance, pricing and option there is just not a car that can compete with it, currently.I highly recommend you go test drive one if you haven't.
5626	Overall a great car.
5631	Infiniti has really hit a home run with the Q50.
5636	Based on looks alone this is a super car.
5637	I like the ES350 better, better ride and better Navagation center ...
5644	This clears the navigation system and resets all the controls.
5649	The car is an Infinity....that says it all!
5650	If you have never had one you will have another and another or you may never need but one.I've seen 420,000 miles on these cars and they still look, drive, perform with style.I've had Acura, Audi, Subaru,Saab,V
5655	Best car I've ever owned.
5662	Its combination of luxury & performance is a step ( or TWO) above others in its class !
5673	I've driven Infinitis for the past 12 years and I have found them relatively trouble free and nicely designed, particularly the first generation g sedan and coupe of which I owned both.
5679	The Q50 is a great car to have.
5684	very refied in look and feel of all the materials inside the cabin.
5685	The outside look is stylish and sporty looking.
5690	I've owned a great many performance cars (two GTO's, Corvette, Audi TT, Shelby Mustang, two Mustang GT's, and 4 Jags among others) and this is by far the best and most enjoyable to drive.
5696	Congratulations to Jag!
5698	Enzo thought the E Type was gorgeous.
5704	I love everything about this car.
5710	Owned a Porsche Cayman S (modified to increase horsepower) and 650i BMW convertible, this car his head and shoulders above them.
5718	It is a small car overall, but that adds to its nimbleness.
5719	The fit and finish is the best, and the quality of materials is impressive.

5909	Great car.
5911	It handled them all amazingly.
5912	It is better looking in person.
5913	Photographs don't do it justice.
5914	We have gotten lots of compliments
5919	As much as I loved the vehicle I couldn't get over the service from the salesman, he wasn't pushy or trying to seal the deal right then and there.
5920	He really catered to my needs.
5926	In the end the other attributes of the Cherokee overcame my disappointment with cargo space, making the 2014 Jeep Cherokee a BUY!
5936	Go and TEST DRIVE ONE TODAY!!!
5937	You will not be disappointed!!
5942	I'm in the market for a compact SUV in the near future and this one is the clear leader.
5945	The Mazda CX-5 is nice, so is the Ford Escape.
5951	fantastic suv at a great price

5957	We had to wait quite awhile for it but it sure seems worth the wait.
5959	Clearly best ride in the class
5964	its a very good car and I recommend to other people

5974	GREAT LITTLE SUV.
5975	I RECOMMED THIS SUV TO ANYONE.
5976	I LOOKED AT CHEVY .NISSAN.
5982	All I can say is a pleasant surprise to find a great smaller suv with a lot of perks for a pretty low price...with great mileage.
5988	Being brand-loyal to Chrysler products and with the price offered, it was an easy choice to make.
5989	I seriously considered and researched competitors, but did not find the higher prices for the competitors justified with respect to potential increased perf
5994	good basic vehicle for northern climate
5999	Big improvement from the 2012 Patriot that I traded in even though the insides are idential.
6000	That cut down on having to adjust to a new ca.r Much less engine noise and it has the feel of a passinger car.
6005	I would highly recommend this vehicle.
6006	It is among the best of the best.
6019	Decent ride and capable jeep.
6020	But even for 55K it is still a jeep.
6036	One of the best cars I have owned with lots of features.
6037	I have not had any problems with the Jeep in 7 months of ownership.
6042	The Grand Cherokee is an excellent choice, we were considering several vehicles in the same segment when we decided to go with the Grand Cherokee and I wouldn't have it any other way.
6047	Overall, I'm been completely statisfied with my 2014 GC Overland.
6048	No major problems.
6054	4k on it so far and I still really like the looks of the GC.The 8 speed tranny is nice, except at low acceleration it's a little lungy getting from 1st to 4th gear.It tows my ATV's with ease with the 5.7L Hemi; although that comes at a price at the pump.
6064	Overall its a great truck - it's a shame they couldn't get the electronics right before releasing it.
6069	Its a good vehicle

6151	I am very pleased with this vehicle which replaced my 11 year old Grand Cherokee.
6152	I liked the old one but this is a step up in terms of luxury and performance.

6174	An extremely well put together and engineered vehicle
6179	The Jeep Grand Cherokee is a wonderful car.
6185	Overall, I am extremely happy with my Liberty.
6186	Thanks to Jeep's cash incentives and dealership discounts, the price of this new vehicle was a bargain.
6187	The ride and handling of the liberty are fantastic for a truck-based SUV... and I can't understand why
6194	Other than that, I really like this Jeep.
6195	It looks great and rides very well.
6196	i would also say it is much quieter than my 2004 GC was.
6197	I love the small chro

6207	It's a great smaller Suv for daily use w/ the convenience of offroad capabilities.
6213	We have never had any issues with our Jeeps and have always loved that they would make it through any winter that was thrown at them.
6214	Time has only improved this ability.
6220	Overall its a good vehicle.
6221	For the price its better than alot of the small suv's.
6222	Its got more of a truck feel than alot of other suvs and a bit of a higher stance.
6223	I like the Latitude trim as it has alot of the Limited options includeing Leather and ch
6233	Good vehicle to own
6238	Good rugged American style vehicle, needs a little refinement
6243	I really like this vehicle - it is the most well rounded design available.
6244	It tows a camping trailer well, is good off road, handles and ride comfortably, is practically sized, and after a year of ownership has been perfectly reliable.
6256	For us, we could not have a better vehicle.
6257	We looked for a long time and knew this was the right truck for us.
6263	good truck for around town.
6264	great in snow.

6293	Have had hardly any trouble with any of my jeeps.
6299	Put a good set of tires on it and you're ready to roll!
6310	We've owned it now for six months and with the exception of the roof side rails and the amount of gas we go through, we are happy with our purchase.
6316	My friend does though so hey at least hes happy.
6327	Great SUV amazingly capable and reminds me of previous cherokee.
6333	great truck tough, strong, good control, feels great while driving.
6334	I recommend it for people who like the feel of a real truck but want something that's not tremendous and takes up lots of space
6345	Overall I like it
6350	I like the fact it's built in Ohio with a great deal of domestic content and American labor.
6351	Mine has been very reliable.
6357	Love my vehicle and If gas mileage and engine power on takeoff were improved, it would be a major contender.
6362	After reading auto magazines reviews, I almost did not consider test driving this vehicle.
6363	I was talked into test driving by co-workers who also purchased, and loved, their Patriots.
6364	I gave it a test drive and I could not believe I was in the same vehicl

6416	Would give a 10 out of 10!
6423	It took a lot of searching to find a nicely equipped Patriot with the 5 speed transmission but it was worth it
6428	For the money, this is a great buy.
6430	Colors are limited, but good.
6431	Not a van and not a car, but a very good choice for something in between.
6436	Great vehicle.
6441	My wife and I LOVE this vehicle!
6442	I just went over the 200k mile mark on my 2004 Tacoma.
6448	Great in every way.

7219	Have fun with it, do the land rover off road events, wnjoy the looks.
7224	Great daily driver.
7225	Very capable vehicle.
7227	For the deals you can get on an LR2, it not only undercuts the X3, Q5, GLK, and XC60 by thousands, but even beats a loaded Tiguan, Escape, etc.
7228	This is really a vehicle that is overlooked by
7233	Nothing has stopped this vehicle so far.
7234	It has made light of snow, ice, mud and country roads in all weather conditions.

7310	Though this vehicle was a lease, I will be certain to consider another Range Rover Sport after the lease expires.
7316	I feel safe behind the wheel of this truck.
7321	I recommend test driving the Sport model but, if you are looking for more of a soft ride vehicle try the Range Rover HSE, non sport model.
7322	This is also a great vehicle also.
7327	best off roading vehicle ever
7334	and it was about $1500 less.
7335	In our minds, it was worth it for the service and quality that Lexus brings.

7390	ALL 100%
7395	wow
7400	This is my first Lexus and first hybrid vehicle and I couldn?t be more pleased.
7401	The car is well-appointed with many of the features you find in a similarly priced luxury vehicle.
7402	The ride is noticeably smooth, tranquil and quiet; perhaps the best in the
7407	this car is outstanding, my second hybrid car and i must say the best, does not lack any comforts and above all else does not look like a cab!!
7412	We had a 2012 ES 350, and enjoy the 2013 ES 300h more.
7413	Not only is the vehicle excellent but the ownership experience provided by the dealer has continued to be excellent.
7414	The controls are easy to understand, but at first, I was less than thrilled with t

7488	It's comfortable, it's good looking, gas mileage is acceptab
7493	Didn't thiink Lexus could improve further, from my past vehicles, but this one did.
7499	Although the Avalon and ES 350 share numerous systems, the overall driving experience in the ES 350 is well worth the extra $3K to $4K.
7504	This is not a  car- this is a fine automobile!
7505	The ride is quiet and comfortable; my gas mileage seems to be better than quoted; and it takes Regular Unleaded vs.

7713	I TRADED A 2013 BMW 750I FOR MY 2013 LEXUS GS350 AND SO GLAD I DID.WATCH OUT BMW HERE COMES LEXUS
7728	I love this car.
7729	When you only spend 5% of your time driving in anger, you want the other 95% to be served by quiet, comfortable compliance.
7730	However you drive, the fierce front end of the F-Sport effectively combines class with intimidation.
7736	Great car; would recommend it to anyone.
7741	Almost 10k miles so far, and still love the car as much as the day I bought it.

7947	It's a real looker and I feel like it will last me awhile, but I'll
7952	I really like the car.
7953	I think it looks great and is fun to drive.
7954	I can see why they say it is better then the BMW 335.
7959	As I already stated, this is the best car and experience I've ever had.
7960	I test drove the new BMW 3 Series and Mercedes C Class, but liked the Lexus much more.
7961	No regrets on my purchase, and I highly recommend this vehicle to others.
7967	makes the drive in the inner city rush hour a whole lot easier to deal with
7985	Excellent choice for drivers wanting a great handling car and a reputation for quality and reliability.

8065	I went and got a 7 series, feels right when you drive any german car.
8075	After having owned five Lexus LS models over the past 16 years, I would say without hesitation that this one is my favorite.
8076	The body style, interior comfort, technology enhancements and responsiveness leave little room for improvement.
8081	pricey but nice.
8086	Awesome vehicle.
8088	It was my retirement gift to myself and I fell so fortunate, safe, empowered and comfortable behind the wheel of my LS.
8099	My 4th LX in 15 yrs!
8104	I can't say enough about this car.
8105	The Audi A7 was wonderful too although the rear seat was tight and the interface, for me, was more difficult, although loved the wifi.
8111	I have owned 10 lexus ls400 series and this is the best by far.
8112	You will like passing the disabled BMWs along side the road.
8113	Plus this is the best dealer service anywhere.
8119	The 2013 LS 460 with its new aggressive look gives Lexus a well needed idenity of there own.Quality,comfort,dependability,and style is what you get with this Lexus, if you are tried of getting stuck out on thehighway with electrical problems in your Euro

8579	Best car ever!
8584	I previously owned a 2010 MKS Eco boost and I absolutely loved that car.
8585	I upgraded to the 2013 MKS Eco boost and it is a totally different car.

8823	The MKX has plenty of power under the hood.

8982	This car is drawing attentiona great indicator for future of the brand!
8983	I have had all ages complement style of the new MKZ from the High School kids to heir Grand Parents.
8993	2013 MKZ is something Lincoln can really be proud of.
8994	The overall concept of the design from head to toe was risky but, well worth the return.
8995	Starting with the powertrain, V6 pumping out 300 horses felt strong and agile.
9001	An amazing vehicle for a reasonable cost.
9002	If you test drive the MKZ after test driving other hybrids, I think you'll agree.
9007	This is an extremely unique vehicle made by a car company willing to raise the bar.
9014	Ford deserves a lot of credit for bringing this car to market and then refining it and pricing it to be competitive.
9016	Owing to the favorable pricing, th
9021	Overall I am extremely happy with my Lincoln MKZ.
9022	I recommend to anyone considering a luxury sporty sedan.
9023	It is much nicer than the BMW, CTS, Audi or Infinity.
9024	If you test drive it you will purchase the MKZ.
9030	The low profile 19's with the painted pocket rims in the Ice Storm blue color is a head turner.
9031	Everyone thinks the car costs 15-20 grand more than it did.

9064	And VERY driver friendly.

9074	It's criminal that there aren't more cars out there like this.
9082	Why isn't everybody driving a Lincoln forcing the price down for all of us.
9088	It is more stylish that the Town Car, has an excellent turning radius, very responsive and offers a quiet and fun driving experience.
9089	I Love it.

9099	One of the best cars I have ever owned (14 so far)

9148	I found this one, and finally decided to get one.
9149	It is doing what I want it to do...*s*
9154	Excellent
9159	a excellent choice
9165	the 40 plus mpg and smooth ride have made mytwo 4000 miles to the east worth the purchase.
9170	With a fillup indicating 750 miles to empty, it's great to just avoid going to the gas station.

9205	Very luxurious, large, and also dependable on the road.
9210	this the best car in the world.
9215	My experience owning these vehicles has been very rewarding.
9216	I would say the styling, V-8 power, comfort, safety features, along with reliability of the TC (probably driven 500,000) miles----has been beyound my expectations.
9217	I will truly miss the Towncar
9222	I would gladly recommend this vehicle to other drivers.
9223	Luxury, quality and looks are great.
9228	I love my Lincoln Town Car and this is number four.

9261	Yes I want one for a daily driver
9266	With my 5 year old in the back seat, I have a renewed enthusiasm for family outings.
9267	I bought the car a bit hastily after I fell in love with it, and I have no regrets.
9273	I am still in awe of this machine.
9274	Power and telepathic handling.
9275	Very forgiving suspension and great stability.
9276	Always makes me smile and my hands sweat a little ;-) Fast and fun.
9277	Turns heads.
9278	Rare.
9283	AWESOME.
9284	For the price (93,000) you can't beat it.
9285	Experts are comparing this to cars well over twice the price.

9413	BEST ever will buy again
9418	The best car ever, it's often mistaken for a limo.
9423	My driver says it is the best car he ever drove.
9428	Want a great awd suv that looks, great, is powerful and gives you 30+ miles per gallon?
9429	Look no further... My sister is buying one this weekend.
9430	After driving with me to Maine, she fell in love with it.
9435	HIGHLY RECOMMEND
9440	A Rav4 does not come close to this car!
9441	Spend the extra and get the Grand Touring-it is well worth it!
9442	The CX-5 with the 2.5 really does drive like a sports car.
9443	It handles almost as well as my Miata did.
9448	2013 CX-5 will be less expensive but getting the 2.5 2014 is well worth the extra cost.
9454	great car for the money, a really good value
9459	This is hands down the most affordable and fuel-efficcient SUV/Crossover that is available on the market.
9460	Not only that, it's a Top Safety Pick, and is loaded with ALL KINDS of options.
9461	Mazda is one of the top manufacturers in the biz today.
9477	Never have been a big fan of Mazda but like this car!
9482	In looking at this class of car, I was interested in the fuel economy, the capability of the engine and the zoom-zoom factor that one expects from Mazda.
9483	I am not disappointed.
9489	Bought new for a great deal, drives like a car, room of a mid-size SUV inside, looks great, true 32 mpg freeway with automatic.
9490	Better than the Honda CRV, better than the Toyota RAV4, in every aspect.
9491	For something you can drive off the lot under 20K, yo
9496	If looking for a great crossover SUV, this one is it in my book.
9497	I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CAR!!!!
9505	I became interested in the CX5 after extensive internet surfing, reading reviews and ultimately traveling over 150 miles to test drive one.
9513	This was a wonderful choice.
9518	Never have been a big fan of SUV's but this one turned me.
9519	A great little SUV for the couple on the go or the small family.
9529	We just bought this SUV a couple of weeks ago and so far it's been absolutely wonderful.
9530	We looked at many compact suvs and the cx5 seemed to be the best option.
9542	Great SUV
9547	my fiance' fights with me over who's car this is, I love the pushbutton start, and keyless entry, we got the sport AWD version, and so far are satified with it's performance on-road, and in severe winter conditions.
9554	The Mazda CX-5 fills the bill for the most part, except it could use at least 20 more hp,
9559	Nice looking SUV with good gas mileage, but they should improve the back seat access by moving back the wheel wells to allow adults to get in and out better.
9566	I am very pleased over all a   pretty vehicle, very sporty looking
9571	Great driving car with the best looks in any SUV I have seen.
9572	Looks good just standing still and drives like a dream.
9573	I am 70 years old and this is the best SUV (or car) I have owned!
9574	You can't help but love to drive it.
9579	Perfect for what we need.
9580	Not too big, not too small and totally fun to drive.
9585	With the new 2.5 liter engine this vehicle feels alive, agile and downright sporty.
9586	The supension, brakes and steering are fantastic.
9587	The interior is capacious and well suited for families.
9588	If you care about driving at all, this is the only vehicle you'l
9600	great car, test drive it and you will be sold
9605	I own another Mazda that I have had for over twenty years without any major repairs.
9606	They do make fun, reliable cars.
9612	Good overall.
9613	I like the fact that you don't see a lot of these on the road.
9614	Glad I waited for 2014 2.5 engine,.
9619	Big upgrade over the CRV this year.
9624	A very impressive small SUV
9629	Great value and very stylish!
9635	This jury is on the same page, excellent product for the money.
9638	I'm a normal guy, that likes normal things, this fits the

9664	An outstanding new addition to the SUV market.
9669	I really enjoy my 2014 Mazda CX5.
9670	The SUV handles very well.
9671	It drives like a race car making sharp turns easy and effortless.
9672	The SUV can accelerate pretty well and it is responsive to my maneuvers.
9673	I like the blind spot monitor, the tire gauge monitor
9678	Going to get my 2014 sky blue in two weeks time, can't wait.
9683	Quieter and better handling than others I drove.
9684	Very happy!
9689	The perfect match for economy and power.
9695	Overall, a good vehicle.
9696	Pickup is good, comparable to the V6in the Escape.
9703	Happy with vehicle overall.
9709	It's the most impressed I've been with a new car in 12 years of buying them.
9714	By far the most fun to drive and best looking CUV in its class (test drove 8 others).
9715	The GT trim is well worth it and comfortable if you enjoy a sporty drive (stiff springs).
9716	Unlike some of its competitors, the advertised highway mileage is achievable a
9721	DRIVE IT AND YOU WILL BUY IT
9726	I ordered it a couple of days after test driving, It's definitely the vehicle I want to be in for the next few years and the most fun SUV I've ever driven.
9736	I would buy another one if I had to or recommend it to another potential buyer
9741	Shortly after we purchased our CX-5, I shared our positive experience with a colleague who was looking at comparable vehicles.
9742	They too had not initially considered the CX-5, but once they did, they were sold.
9743	It too has become their vehicle of choice.
9749	Close to a perfect small SUV.
9751	Interior, technology and quality are all outstanding.
9756	Outside of an MGB driven eons ago, this is my first  foreigncar and must say I am delighted with Japanese technology and styling.
9757	Recommend the tech package highly.
9758	The bells and whistles on this vehicle are superb and you won't be disappointed.
9764	Would Recommend and Purchase this car Again.
9769	Fun to drive

9808	It's little but has tons of   zoom-zoom.
9814	great car,better than the honda crv , I had
9819	If you want a 5-passenger SUV that offers great looks, playful driving manners, impressive technology and good value, the 2014 Mazda CX-5 deserves a test-drive.
9820	That it boasts class-leading fuel economy of up to 35 mpg feels like icing on an already tast
9825	Great car, great on gas, more fun to drive than any other SUV I have ever driven.

9995	the best overall value in this minuscule category of almost a real car
10000	it a good little car
10005	Most fun small car that should last and is cheap to buy and run.
10026	Love the Sprited green, really turns heads.
10027	My wife drives this car more than her Infiniti EX35.
10033	I would highly recommend this car to anyone looking for an inexpensive commuter that can double for traveling reasonable distances on vacation and carry plenty of stuff for shopping ... good stereo, good lights, cruise control, alloys ... just needs more
10038	Of all the vehicles that I test drove, I would buy this one again.
10043	This is a fun, sporty car.
10044	It is great on gas and is fun to drive.
10045	I recommend this for people that are economical and   hip  !
10050	cheap, cheap, cheap.
10055	I am used to driving luxury cars.
10057	compares favorably to any of them and at a dramattcally lower price.
10074	A lot of car for the money!
10079	Having owned this car for about 3 months now and 3500 miles, I could not be happier with it.
10080	I feel that Mazda has but its best foot forward on this car.
10086	great car for the price
10091	Great value as I compared other cars in the segment.
10093	Very happy with all the features.
10094	Great seats, excellent entertainment and navigation system..
10095	Very accurate voice control system.
10096	Definitely have and will recomm
10101	This is the best quality car for my need and ride.The highest torque is at a low engine rotation compared to other competitors of this C class car.Those who are looking for C class cars should at least look at and feel it and test drive.Mazda is not like
10106	Great handling car , back seat & wind noise were my main problem,salesman were awesome & not pushy
10111	2014 Mazda3 is best summed up as a game changer.
10112	It has come back and it is on a mission.
10113	From the smiling grill to the new design language of the Mazda brand has definitely turned the 3 into a smooth and attractive option.
10119	Excellent Car
10124	3 thumbs up

10142	Displays are clearly marked and simple, not l
10147	GREAT ALL AROUND CAR.
10152	I traded in a recent Forester Subaru, again, very sensible, and plain, yet, the M5 is extremely fun and a great value for the dollar.
10158	Mazda 5 has so many user-friendly features, overlooked by many, but build in as part of the overall concept of versatility and exceptional value.
10159	There are not many ways to shape a mini-van  box , but I feel the M5 is stylish, aerodynamic, and I like it.
10164	The Mazda6 is an awesome attractively priced mid-sized car for people who like to drive.
10165	Styling is jag-like, interior is almost Germanic in functionality, and the new Skyactiv engine and drivetrain has been delivering 28 mpg in the city consistently.
10171	Anyone who is in the market for a new sedan with a quality feel, great looks, class leading fuel economy and sporty handling should drive this car.
10176	2014 Mazda 6 really stands out amongst its peers.
10177	With new designs of the Fusion, Altima, and Accord the Mazda had to bring something out to attract car buyers.
10178	Exterior and interior on the 6 is definitely sharp and it will get your neighbors attention.
10183	In my one week of ownership over all I am pleased with the car intended functions....Its fun to drive and it makes my driveway look sexier than ever before...I thoroughly checked out all the competition (Nissan, Honda, Toyota) and this car was the only c
10188	Perfect balance of sport and family hauler.
10189	Loads of tech available if you want it, plenty of standard features for the more value minded.
10190	And 38mpg!
10191	Mazda has a winner with this one.
10196	From a single test drive, this has jumped almost to the top of my short list of cars to potentially replace my 13 year old Acura TL.
10201	After test-driving the competition from Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Ford and Kia, this is hands down the best midsize sedan on the market right now.
10202	I come from driving Toyotas all my life but have become a Mazda believer.
10208	MPG, great styling, comfort features and fun to drive, all at a reasonable cost, were the priority features I was searching for.
10209	Overall, this is a great car for the money.
10217	I dropped Civic and 3 w/out even looking, thinking why go small when small family is growing?
10225	I wanted to get one as soon as I saw the new design.
10226	I knew I'd have to give up a V6 but must say the 4 cyl took off quite well.
10233	Moving up from a 2010 Mazda6 GT Plus this vehicle is better equipped.
10234	With a little over 300 miles I have averaged nearly 30 MPG with mixed driving.
10235	I'm still rolling on the new car tank of gas.
10236	The ride is much more quiet than my 2010.
10242	Near perfection for someone desiring a fun to drive, safe, roomy and fuel efficient mid-size sedan.
10248	Darn right especially with a diesel!!!
10254	It's just about perfect for a family sedan.
10255	You name it, we test drove it - the combination of exterior and interior styling, size, handling and feature content are hard to beat
10260	IIHS top safetypick, zoom-zoom, great mpg, great looks...I guess it is the full package.
10261	I really think it is an excellent value for the $$
10266	I fell in love with this car off of the looks alone, I never test drove I only sat in the car at a local dealer.
10267	I purchased the vehicle through TRUE CAR, best choice I could have made I saved over $2500 of MSRP.
10273	Car and Driver name it the best car in its class over the Honda Accord EX and from my experince I agree.
10280	Great car- you get a lot for your money.
10281	Lots of technology options for your money and overall a great looking car- that looks, drives and feels like a much more expensive unit.
10286	Would highly recommend it is sporty and a great price in comparison to other cars in this class.
10287	Love all the features.
10292	Easily in the top tier of all current mid sized vehicles.
10297	This is a great car, it's fun to drive.
10298	The only cars that I drove and liked more were the Hyundai Sonata and Honda Accord.
10303	One of the best new cars on the market.
10304	I use to buy Mazda's all the time in the 80 and 90 but left when Mazda teamed up with ford but I am back now...
10309	Every detail in the car , starting from the Engine , I-loop technology and the sensors to the styling inside and out is very well thought of , and you could easily feel that.
10315	Great car.
10316	Should cost over $10,000 more, but do not tell Mazda.
10321	Excellent car.
10322	So good I cannot believe I do not see more on the rode.
10327	This is the best car I've ever had, and I've had two BMWs.
10329	It handles both surfaces equally well.
10330	I have the GT in Soul Red, so it looks great and is fully loaded.
10341	Compared to Camry, Accord, Altima (all of which I have driven) this is a driver's car that is tight and fun to drive unlike the others.
10342	Handling is crisp and tight.
10348	We still love this car.
10349	A lot of people come up to us and ask question on the car.
10350	I also love the gas mileages that I get.
10351	it's wonderful A lot of people love the color and style .
10356	love it, love it , love it
10370	This is an exceptional car.
10371	I am in the market for a car and this definitely is in top 3.
10372	Understated luxury that is classy.
10373	Just with a few tweaks and it is a no brainer.
10378	The 2014 Mazda 6 is the working man's Exotic Sports Sedan!
10379	Its voluptuous curves, cavernous interior, and above grade fit and finish, lets it stand out in a crowded field of Full Size Sedans.
10385	Highly recommended.
10386	It rides better than the accord/altima with junky CVT.
10387	Automatic Trans, works very well.
10392	One of my top 5 picks to buy
10397	Mazda is has created a vehicle that provides best in market value along with a vehicle that is fun to drive.
10402	Excellent car for the money good quality feels solid.
10407	Excellent car.
10408	Did i say the gas mileage is awesome?
10413	I am 100% satisfied.
10418	Very Simply Amazing, getting 32.5 mpg mostly around town, wish it had a tad more zoom, but understand that's a trade off for the 32.5 mpg
10423	Love the car!
10428	Anybody looking for a Mid-sized car would be making a big mistake by not looking at this car.
10429	It is simply far and away above the Camry, Accord, Sonata, Optima, Altima and Fusion.
10435	It's a great car and I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new car.
10440	An excellent looking and fun to drive sedan.
10441	Mazda's redesign of the 6 is simply stunning, and the value delivered both in fuel economy and in safety features is really compelling.
10447	Once you do you will end up buying it.
10452	The only fault I can find in the 2014 Mazda 6 is that it is taking me a little time to adjust to the difference in power after owning a 2011 Grand Touring with the V6.
10459	I'm happy I made that decision.
10464	The 2014 Mazda 6 is the clear choice for those looking for an overall nice vehicle which is fun to drive.
10465	It has many technological advances with luxury sedan safety features.
10466	Young or old, you'll love the new Mazda 6.
10471	Best new Mazda in years!
10476	Do your self a favor and at least test drive the Mazda 6, before you decide to buy any other car.
10481	Great car!
10482	I love it!!
10487	Great car!
10488	I love it!!
10495	for starters it costs less and it gives really good gas mileage for a midsize sedan.
10501	Very affordable, reliable, economical and overall value for price paid.
10506	Good Car
10511	Thanks to Mazda for offering fun to drive, solid handling cars with tons of value.
10512	Mazdaspeed 3 rules!
10517	Great car, fun to drive.
10522	I love this car.
10523	I've owned 4 Mazdas and each one just gets better and better.
10534	With the tech package, you get everything you can wish for in a car for under $30k.
10540	Lots of power but will remain calm and composed if driven as such.
10541	Lots of fun to drive and commands respect on the road.
10546	I do recommend getting this if you want something cheap and quick, its a great car to have as your 2nd car.
10547	Its a solid car and really enjoyable to drive.
10557	great little   hot hatch if you want performance for the money I would highly recommend this car, and if you can swing it get one with the tech package,i love mine!!
10562	good car
10567	Mazda MX-5 Miata was named to Car and Driver Magazine's 10 Best Car list for 2013.
10572	A well-built, fast, stylish car, that's too much fun to drive!
10577	The Club model rocks!
10578	The styling is awesome.
10579	The 6 speed MT is smooth as butter, the suspension is firm and road hugging, Plus the car is light on it's wheels and a blast to drive!

10594	If you're in the market for a sports car, you seriously cannot go wrong with a Miata.
10595	No, it's not as fast as a Porsche, but it is way cheaper to maintain and frankly unless you're taking it on the track every day the power is certainly above average con
10600	great car for the price,it is right up there with the BMW
10605	great car for the price,it is right up there with the BMW
10610	This is a true sports car.
10611	It handles, accelerates and feels great.
10612	It is like my old mgb except I don't have to work on it every weekend.
10617	There are plenty of cars that can go faster in a straight line., but nothing under $50,000 that can make you smile like this car.
10622	Great car with lots of potential.
10623	Excellent in reliability.
10628	perfect
10633	Unfortunately Mazda has stopped production of the Rx-8, but the heart and soul lives on with their final revision known as the Spirit R. I commend and respect a company that continuously innovates and truly believes in their product.
10639	Owning an RX8 is like being married to a beautiful but wayward womanYou keep saying you'll take it back one more timeAnd just when you get ready to trust it againBang!
10645	I would recommend it
10650	Car handles like a dream.
10652	Handled well even in the snow with snow tires.
10657	Love this car
10667	I like the 2004 model year the best due to the extra HP.
10669	I've put 40K miles on my RX8, & the only problem has been the replacement of a catalytic converter... which Mazda covered/paid for.
10675	Problem free for over a year.
10680	I have had my Mazda Tribute just under 6 months & I have loved my Tribute i sport & will consider another Mazda down the road.
10685	PROBABLY THE BEST CAR I'VE OWNED.
10692	This is my 3rd Mazda, and the Tribute just confirms what I already love about Mazdas.
10697	should make good use of the brand
10707	Except for the Porsche 911 Carrera I had(totally different concept obviously), it's the best I've owned...sold on this new Merc
10714	You will buy it.
10719	Fun to look at.Fun to drive.Good mpg.Responsive handling.

10806	The only problem we had was finding the right GL450 available in the color and options we wanted without having to wait for an order.The ride, handling and performance is terrific and with us owning it for 6months and driving almost 5,000 miles so far I
10811	The engine and ride was thumbs up.
10830	Love it, diesel!
10835	If you can afford it and want to enjoy your life, Go for it.
10840	I like the size of the vehicle which is slightly smaller than my Escalade and the road handling.
10841	I like the electric fold down third row and the space it has.
10842	Also like the cargo space with second row down when traveling for suitcases, etc.
10847	My 450 has all the new and modern safety features that i was looking for.
10852	Quite rewarding experience.
10858	This is my third ML & by far it is best one.
10859	So very much improved over my 2000 ML320 and I loved my 2004 ML350 with its improvements, but my, oh, my, my 2012 is like driving a cloud!
10865	Truly the best vehicle I have ever owned.
10866	Pricey but worth it if you can afford it...you only live once.
10876	For me, this is a perfect all-purpose vehicle, just the right size and easy to parallel park.
10877	Basically, it's a modern version of a station wagon with all wheel drive.
10882	This is by far the best vehicle I have owned.
10883	It is powerful, handles well, is quiet and loaded with cutting edge electronics.

11069	Fast,responsive and great looking car
11074	We looked at a BMW 3 series and a Lexus IS 250C before buying this car We are very happy with the SLK.

11306	Nice comfortable, quality SUV.
11307	No complaints.
11312	Its too bad that 2012 is going to be Galant's last year... Its kind of simple, but for sure a great dependable family vehicle.
11330	The 2012 is a contender.Although the styling is not in your face like Hyundai, it is easy to get in and out of both front and rear seats without bending your neck.
11335	Great value, I bought a used 2012 Galant for almost half the price when it was new.

11405	Overall this is a fantastic vehicle.
11406	I feel like I'm driving a luxury crossover, but paid a compact price!!!!
11411	As much as we liked out 2011 Outlander, it was an easy choice to go with the new 2014.
11412	With very few other SUV/Crossovers to choose from with a third row seat, AWD and mileage close to 30 mpg, this is the perfect vehicle for our young family of 4.
11418	Great SUV for the price.
11423	I drove the rav4, cx-5, forester XT, This vehicle leaves them all in the dust.
11424	The Mitsu engineers have done a very good job.
11425	Only the mazda can match it in terms handling.
11426	The outlander is a lot of fun.
11427	I look forward to driving every morning.
11433	I would put this SUV up against any 4 cyl RAV4, CRV or Escape!!
11438	I think consumers should test drive this SUV.
11439	I can see why the EVO is legendary .
11441	In snow, it gives me great confidence.
11442	Just don't listen to the jornalists who disklike mitsubishi and do not give this suv the cred
11447	I love my Outlander, My son bought a Outlander Sport at the same time, he loves the Sport.
11461	Discounted it can't be beat for pricing and features.Best deal going if you test drive it and ignore the media stigma on Mitsubishi.
11466	The design took a while to grow on me, but after checking out this car at the dealer, I fell in love right away.
11467	The quality and value are miles ahead of the bigger car companies, and they back it up with a great warranty.
11473	The Mitsubishi product gives you a great value at an affordable price.
11478	would recommend this to anyone that wants a great SUV with for an incredible price..
11483	What a find.
11484	I couldn't be happier.
11485	Perfect family car: Safe drive and fun!
11486	Winter and offroad ready.
11491	I think this is an incredible value for the price.
11492	What's not to love?
11497	after owning countless BMW's, Mercedes and Corvettes, the 911 is quite simply the BEST!
11502	Awe inspiring engineering; great for daily driving too.
11507	There is nothing else like it.
11508	Although affordable to only a few, it is the most thrilling and capable thing on 4 wheels.
11513	Wonderful car-will buy another one.
11518	Drive it.
11519	Incredible value and performance.
11524	Wow, just drive one.
11530	I can't wait until my Boxster is built.
11533	I still remember the test drive.
11534	It was great and I felt free driving with the top down.
11539	The Boxster S has incredible acceleration, cornering and breaking capabilites.
11540	It is very comfortable and smooth on the open road.
11541	It's a 10+ and i would highly recommend this vehicl for anyone looking to enjoy the purity of a true Sports Car.Well Done P
11546	The visual appearance (lines) of this car are amazing.
11547	Certain cars, Jag XK, Audi 5, look great parked; the redesigned Boxster is now in this category.
11548	Performance wise- it rocks; especially the Boxster S. At the same time you can drive it around town.
11554	I would buy it again, in a heart beat.
11556	For the price it really should have these two options.
11561	A great car for those who enjoy driving.
11562	Dynamite styling, excellent build quality, and all the performance you need for driving within legal limits, even with the base version.
11569	great truck
11574	Great truck, people at the dealership are really nice.
11575	Will go back for our next vehicle for sure.
11580	I have been pulling a cattle trailer around with this truck for a few months now and love it.
11581	There is no better deal out there.
11582	THe truck has more than enough power and gets better gas mileage than either of my chevys.
11583	Couldnt believe how truely nice th
11588	All accessories have operated flawlessly; The available storage in the cabin and the Ram box are excellent no need to install an aftermarket storage box.
11595	The Ram is a VERY nice truck.
11596	Much better for in-town and light duty driving and hauling, and in a totally dif
11601	Owned a 2009 Ram 1500, the 2013 model has a revised interior which is much approved.
11602	The fit and finish of the interior is on par with that of luxury autos.
11603	I compared this vehicle with the Ford F150 and the Toyota Tundra and there is no doubt the Ram is
11608	I think for the money it is the best truck out there.
11609	I have friends who own new Fords and Chevys they are very nice trucks but they agree dollars worth winner is the Ram.
11614	Best Buy
11619	i was a chevy man for 45 years and now i am a dodge dude for the rest off my life!
11624	Chevy, the imports, and GMC are not even in the same league.It's all about Ford vs Ram now.I hate the low end torque of the Ram as bolted to a 6 spd.Ford has that nailed.But I'd put the Ram interior against anything, anything.I'd put uconnect against Any
11637	A best buy,Ram trucks are real trucks, coil spring rear suspension and hemi engine are hard to beat.
11643	I still think it is nicer on the exterior than the chevy.
11651	Why did I wait soooo long to dump the SUV and get a pick-em-up truck!?
11656	This is the best.

12114	This is the most fun I have had behind the wheel in a decade!
12115	Not a family vehicle, but a fun ride each and every time.
12116	When you add in the great gas mileage it muliplies the benefits of ownership.
12121	Good acceleration, but it is mostly a beautiful car that can be pushed to its and your driving limits!
12126	I think that this is a really great car, regardless of the fact that it is so inexpensive.

12140	I purchased a base Nissan 370Z for 29k, test drove similarly equipped FR-S and priced for 28k.One must be not understand can get a REAL sports car for right under 30k (Nissan 370Z) to buy the FR-S

12175	I have not seen another one yet so it is still unique.
12187	Fantastic car.
12188	Love it even more than corvettes I have had
12193	I have owned my FR-S for about six months and it is far and away the best car I've ever owned.
12194	It can be a bit finicky to shift at times, and is always begging for a speeding ticket, but this car delivers a ridiculous amount of style and performance for
12199	I overall think its a fun car to drive
12204	I am 47 years old and this little car puts a smile on my face every time I drive it, heck, every time I look at it.
12205	I actually look forward to driving it and sometimes I make excuses just to get out and take it for a spin.
12210	After over 30 years of driving front wheel drive automatics I returned to my sports car roots (MG Midget, Mini, Sunbeam Alpine & Tiger, Fiat 124 Spyder) and do not regret my decision.
12211	This is a modern sports car with none of the problems or shortcomings
12216	WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A LEAST 225 HORSES AND MORE TORQUE BUT THE CAR IS AN EYE STOPPER AS IT IS.
12228	I love this car, so glad I bought it.
12233	This is the best driving car I've ever owned.
12234	I get constant compliments on it too, which is kind of fun!

12241	The FR-S makes for a very enjoyable third car.
12242	The gas mileage is very good for a sports car.
12248	I can not wait to buy my new Scion FR-S!!!

12265	It is so much fun, and I drive it hard.
12266	If you are looking at getting one, please do, you will be happy.
12273	loved the general feel and look of the car, if you dont carry extra passengers often or pick up tons of stuff at the store its a perfect fun choice
12278	Buy one and you'll see what I mean.
12283	The is a true sports-car.
12284	Its not one of those lame muscle-cars like the mustang or camaro or challenger.
12285	This car is for enthusiasts, not rednecks!
12290	nice car, fun to drive, but slow.
12295	I definitely think that it was a great choice.
12296	I bought this car as an every day driver and it hasn't disappointed me at all.
12297	It is a blast to drive and I can push this car on a turn without fear of losing control.
12303	great car and fun to drive.
12308	I have had this car for over two months and still look forward to driving every day.
12314	Thats fine, I ask then when was the last time you got change from a $20 when you filled your gas tank.
12320	The quality and attention-to-detail with the engineering is on-par with much, much more pricey cars like the Lexus and Mercedes.
12321	It even comes with 0-20w Synthetic oil that only needs cha
12327	But if you're looking for something small that gets above-average gas mileage and has some personality (I'm looking at you, Prius family) for a r
12332	This is a great little car.. Big on interior room if you consider it a two sweater..which it really is.
12333	Very customizable.
12334	Great on gas.
12335	Easy to park and maneuver
12340	Great car to save you money even if you have a lead foot.
12342	The comfort room is comparable to mid-sized cars and for some mid-sized the IQ is heads and shoulders the winner for comfort.
12348	Great second car to run errands in.
12353	i love this car and it is the best gas saver vehicle that i've owned.
12359	Nothing less than we expected, with a few pleasant surprises re some standard equipment items included.If you want small, economical means of transportation, this is a good choice.
12365	Great car, decent acceleration, good reliability.
12370	A great second car for the price, enjoyable driving experience, and high mpg for a non-hybrid, but be sure it fits your driving habits and I wonder how the EPA gave it a 36/37.
12375	I just love this little car!
12376	So much fun to drive and since all my outings end up in parking lots, this little guy just makes parking lots of any shape or size a snap to park in.
12382	A whole lot of car for the price.. sporty enough to go when you need to, enough horse power for hills (so far).
12383	Sound system is stellar/ipod bluetooth is very nice.
12384	I love driving this car.
12389	For anyone that would like a reliable, good looking, sportscar, the Scion tC is for you.

12448	The Scion suits my driving habits and lifestyle perfectly.
12449	It's reliable--of course!--, comfortable, responsive, and just plain fun to be in.
12455	Great cra, I owned a 2009 and just upgraded to a 2012, love my smart.
12456	Great MPG, parking is a snap and yes limited storage but I can fit 2 sets of golf clubs in the back.
12461	Not for everyone, but for more than the media has given it credit for.
12464	Not necessarily in the best way, although this car makes most people smile.
12470	If you want cheap fun transport with a good warranty, buy one.
12472	I pack mine with my wife, me, one large Lab and a noisy Schuanzer and head to the farm quite often.
12478	This vehicle is fun to drive although no speed demon.

12504	Doesn't get better than this car.
12514	Excellent vehicle, cheapest car to own and the most fun for the money.
12519	If everybody uses this car the traffic won't be here because these cars are so small they cant possible get into traffic, but they could get into trouble!
12524	I love my SMART CAR!!
12529	The Smart will exceed your expectations.
12530	fun to drive and it will hold a lot more than you would ever think or need for that mater It's like glue on the Interstates and trucks are no bother at all.I have had mine for 4 1/2 years.
12531	I'll get a new one prett
12536	Great car.
12541	GREAT VEHICLE-
12547	Perfect second car.
12548	The only time I drive my other car is to Church on Sunday, or when the weather is severe, heavy flooding rain and windy,It's
12559	I was amazed at how much space was inside for how small it looked on the outside ( I'm a big guy 6' 290 and I fit in it just fine).

12716	A must see for Tesla Model S enthusiasts.Go to YouTube and search for  Tesla Model S Review
12721	Absolutely fantastic.
12726	This is, by far, the best car I have ever been in, let alone owned.
12731	If you see a very negative review of a Tesla, it will be written by someone on the traditional automotive business.
12738	Simply the best car ever!
12739	(well, at least in the 52 years I have been driving, to include a 64 and 68 'vette).
12744	Overall a wonderful car.
12745	I believe I am driving the future of automobiles today.
12750	super excellent
12755	A full 10
12760	A car of excellence beyond expectations
12765	This car is the future.
12766	Elon Musk is a visionary who has taken the available technology to the next level, and will continue to do so.
12767	We purchased this vehicle at the high point dollar wise, but it is an investment that will hopefully lead to lower pric
12773	It is in a class by itself.
12774	It must be experienced to understand completely how it changes the paradigms.
12780	This car is a game changer- you must get in one to appreciate how much better a car it is than all of the other cars on the road today.
12781	In the future all cars will be like this.
12782	There is obviously a reason why Consumer Reports gave it the highest rating
12787	I truly believe this car has taken things to another level and will go down in history (with Elon Musk alongside) as one of the most influential innovations/innovators of our time
12792	The best car ever built worldwide by a longshot.
12795	If you have a solar cell carport and a Tesla Model S. You can charge your car unlimitedly for free!
12801	The future is here.
12802	Watch out, big oil!
12807	The car gets better over time as more features are added via software release.
12812	I want i want one I want one I want Oh Santa please bring me one
12817	This car has to be driven to realize how game changing it truly is.
12818	Before my test drive another person showed up in a $150K car and even he was wowed by the performance.
12819	For local use this would be a great car.
12825	We agree this car is destined to become a classic; it's truly groundbreaking yet achingly simple and precise in concept, design and implementation.
12826	This is what American ingenuity is about.
12837	This car may not be foreveryone, but neither is a 911, corvette or panamera.
12844	Until you drive one of these, you have no idea what an electric car designed from the ground up can be.
12851	Excellent car!
12856	Best car I've ever driven!
12857	Highly recommend it!
12862	I am enjoying a new kind of ride

12905	What a pleasure to drive past gas stations and help the environment too.
12906	Oh, it's also so fast and responsive so that driving is fun again.
12907	My other car is a 2006 Prius which, in comparison, is real basic transportation.
12912	This car is a masterpiece; a treat to drive, and a dream to own I'm sure.
12913	I'm trying to convince my fiance that this should be our next car.
12914	:)
12922	Sell more.Lots more!!
12927	Best car I ever had!
12932	It's an amazing piece of machinery.
12955	Run, don't walk to your nearest Subaru dealer - they're only bringing 5,000 into the US the first year.
12960	this is a pretty good car to buy
12966	I can honestly say, this car handles better !
12971	Go with the LTD model in a 6MT and see how driving can be fun again.
12973	But I found a Satin Pearl White one and have never looked back.
12979	Run, don't walk to your nearest Subaru dealer - they're only bringing 5,000 into the US the first year.
12984	Great car for going through a mountain road.
12989	I love the BRZ, but not as a daily drive car.
12995	Looking forward to Spring and summer you better believe.
12996	Bring on those old country roads.
13001	Simply a suburb modern lightweight sports car.
13002	It's a Japanese Lotus They got it just right.
13003	If you like the feeling of being on rails when you're negotiating a corner, you have to drive this car.
13008	i would by this car again in a heartbeat,fantasic car
13013	a true sports car
13018	Absolutely great sports car with a good price and good amenities.
13023	Go get you one!
13028	Zhas exceeded my expectations in all areas of performance, handling and style.
13029	Her appearance is that of a higher priced vehicle.
13030	When purchasing a BRZ, even though there is a back seat, factoring in comfort it really is a  two-seater , which is great
13035	Just recently was fortunate enough to get one.
13036	Love everything about it.
13041	Great car I love mine and so has anyone who has driven in it with me!!!!!!!
13046	Lightweight, Good horsepower for the size, fun to drive!
13051	Great buy!!!
13052	Worth taking car of.
13057	This is the car to buy if you want the near perfect balance of style, performance, appearance and quality.
13063	great looking car at a not so great price when you should have recieved the ultimate machine from subaru,just like mitsu and thier eclipse ,both companies missed the mark of what we want as tuners/sport car drivers.imho
13075	would buy this car again
13080	Excellent vehicle for someone who appreciates driving.
13093	i would by this car again in a heartbeat,fantasic car
13098	got out with a mile-wide smile
13103	Fun, fun , fun...Yeah an extra 30 HP would be nice but not a deal breaker.
13104	Radio could be better too....Ive got the limited and i think its well worth the 28 Grand i paid.
13111	Overall, Recommended for a sporty, fun car to afford one many smiles that is affordable.
13112	Not a speed demon, but find the curves and corners and you can imagine yourself in a very high end car driving experience very easlily.
13117	An incredible value!
13122	Great platform,howeverI am going to wait for the STI version or the 2014 WRX Or when a 4x4 version becomes available.
13127	Still a very fun car to drive which turns alot of heads.
13128	Looks more expensive than it is.
13139	I love the design, perhaps in a year or two they will enhance the engine.
13144	If you just want a toy, to play around with, and don't live in the snow belt, this is a good car to play with.
13146	I was crazy for buy
13151	Great driving car
13156	Absolutely Outstanding - a home run for Subaru!
13161	Subaru hit it out of the ballpark with the all new 2014 Forester!!!!!!!
13162	Looking to be Motor Trend SUV of the year for 2014.
13167	This car is a winner.
13168	I got out of my 2012 Forester lease early to buy this vehicle and it's my 3rd Forester.
13169	The car is more solid and the CVT transmission is quiet and delivers greater than the mpg stated.
13175	This is a terrific vehicle.
13176	I traded up from a 2010 and don't regret it.
13184	Test drove all the competition and the Subaru blew them all away.
13185	Great vehicle.
13190	Excellent car for the money
13195	Great car and much more for your money than Rav, CRV,Outlander or Equinox (the others we considered).
13196	The electronic power steering took a couple days to get used to but now I love it.
13197	To top it off, Subaru also offers free break pads and wiper blade rep
13209	They directed me to Grand Subaru Bensenville, IL 3.2i Limited andI got awesome price for all models.
13210	I had to wait 8 weeks since 2014 model is sold out.
13215	Great car!
13220	Great ride
13226	Test drove the Mazda CX5 first and compared to that model, the Subaru lags in handling and road feel.
13232	Well built, solid feel and very comfortable.
13233	Aside from the defrost issue it's an excellent value.
13245	Love the Subarus and this is my 3rd one.
13251	The turbo version drives very smoothly and quietly, with only a touch of hesitation.
13258	Bot 2.5i premium, I was surprised at the acceleration with cvt, rear camera is good but screen could have been a little bigger.Ride is very good and controlled.
13259	The View around the vehicle is good , no blind spots.
13260	Sunroof is huge.
13266	Overally I would choose this vehicle again.
13268	The forester provides the best bang for your buck.
13274	great car
13279	Great Performance and Safety Record
13289	I really wanted to like this vehicle besides it's unnecessarily conservative looks.
13297	Well put together.
13298	The total package.
13303	Love, love, love this vehicle!
13304	It is wonderful!
13309	Great vehicle , wish the extra's ( hitch , cargo cover, etc.
13325	I think the forester is a great vehicle.
13334	There is nothing to compare Subaru to.....
13335	There is no other manufacturer that can deliver a unbeatable AWD system and almost 9 of ground clearance for $20,000.
13340	Overall the forester is a great vehicle.
13341	i researched like crazy before buying it,and am very happy!
13346	overall this is best car ever owned!!
13352	You have drive the Forester to appreciate it.
13353	It is a far better buy than the Outback because the Outback is selling too well for dealers to price it more fairly.
13360	I settled on the Subaru because I felt it provided the most features for the price & was the top choice of Consumer reports for quality & safety.. Review ID:
13365	Run, don't walk to get one!
13371	they were both garbage in comparison.this forester is the best thing under $30,000I tested the RAV4, Escape, CRV, and reviewed the others, they were pathetic in comparison.check out some of the comparison v
13376	Owned many cars and suv's This could be the most fun suv I've driven
13381	Great
13387	This lived up to our expectations.
13388	It won Suv of the Year in a Car magazine!!!
13398	This vehicle is hard to beat for it's price.
13399	This is another reason why Subaru sales are soaring.
13404	great SUV
13409	Highly recommend the car.
13419	A great little car that feels bigger than it is, excellent fuel economy and handling.
13420	Here in the midwest the AWD comes in real handy, snow, rain, freezing rain, you never know what you'll get, I ski, bike and kayak, the roof racks and storage are great
13425	I absolutely love this car in the Hatchback.
13426	I use it as a city car in NYC and it fits that role perfectly.
13427	It handles great, takes potholes like a champ.
13428	The visibility while driving is perfect and I feel like I can see everything that is going on aroun
13433	a great car if you want a car that feels big and still gives you mpg and awd at a great price
13438	Love it!
13439	Safe, zippy, small, tough, reliable.
13444	Overall, this is a wonderful car for me as I drive it back and forth to work daily.
13445	I save on fuel costs with the fuel efficiency it offers and I don't have to worry about the weather conditions with the All-Wheel Drive.
13446	So, it is safe AND economical.
13452	Great deal all around, I looked at vw tdi wagons and their premium price tag was not worth the extra 2 mpg's
13457	Great Car
13462	Excellent car, although acceleration is slow handling and breaking is very good.
13463	I get about 32 mpg combined, which is excellent for an AWD car.
13464	The car looks good and is very simple, which is good for reliability.
13465	It will get you where you need to go in
13471	Not too many of those from which to choose, but the impreza suits my needs perfectly.
13472	I can park it easily in the city, I get the advertised 36 mpg on the highway where I spend much of my time,
13477	Im used to high perfomance 200+ HP but this is the first time ive actually been impressed with the Impreza.
13478	Its great all around because with the AWD you dont feel the lag from FWD cars when you accelerate.
13484	if it's not for the oil consumption, I love this car.
13489	Most fuel efficient and economical  ALL WHEEL DRIVEvehicle out there for a best buy !
13490	Now I hear the XVCrosstrek will be produced as a hybrid in 2014 which will make leaps and bounds for the Subaru name as being a fuel efficient economical automobile.
13495	Very good small car.
13496	Does great in the snow.
13497	Very pleased with this car.
13502	Great little 5 door hatchback.
13505	Road noise level much reduced with tire change out.
13506	Handling also improved and snow traction
13511	The awd and safety features gives a very secure feeling when driving.
13512	Excellent gas milage considering it has all wheel drive.
13514	Simple and reliable.
13515	Comfortable and spacious for passengers with excellent cargo versatil
13521	At first i was not impressed with the car, even though the interior was a good improvement over the previous generation Subarus.
13522	I'm not a fan of hatchbacks, but after driving it
13527	Versatile performer!
13533	With plenty of HP, AWD, Brembo brakes, and tuned sport suspension, it's a real performer.
13538	Great fun and you can drive it in the winter...STi and snow tires is there anything more fun?
13543	Seriously consider this car for the 25-30k range...great feel, easy to drive, great performance when you need it in awd.
13548	While not the perfect car its engine, AWD, and suspension more than makes up for its deficiencies.
13549	Its rally heritage can be felt and it gives the driver a raw and exciting feeling of a true drivers car.
13550	To get this feel usually requires paying much more
13555	If you enjoy the driving experience while keeping practicality, this is the car for you.
13557	Very comfortab
13562	I think I will injoy this car for years to come.
13567	LOVE this car, can't ever imaging owning anything but a Subaru
13572	get this car, cant beat the value for the price and the gas milage
13583	I would recommend the legacy to everyone out there looking for a dependable and affordable vehicle!
13588	Good family car.
13594	Overall, I'm very happy with the Legacy.
13595	Time will tell how trouble free it is, but Subaru does have a good reputation.
13596	Also, it is built in Indiana by American workers (non-union I suppose .. which is a plus in my book).
13613	Paddles are great!
13614	Will buy the same brand.
13625	I intend to buy one soon
13630	Love this car I don't why I never looked seriously at a Subaru before.
13635	This vehicle is the best value I have owned and that includes Hondas, Cadillacs, Audis, Acuras and Infinitis.
13636	This is the Swiss Army knife of vehicles!
13641	If you are not in a hurry, and want a solid wagon with AWD, a decent cargo area, and nice build quality...
13642	This is the vehicle for you.
13650	It is a great car, can haul a ton, and easily fits 4 adults.
13651	The mid cycle changes are great.
13652	Love the new electroluminescent instrument cluster and having the temperature gauge.
13658	This car is an all around winner.
13659	Luxury when you need it, with the outdoor fun when you want it.
13660	She is a beautiful car, with many admirers - I am really enjoying having a look good; go anywhere; haul anything vehicle!
13665	After months of test-driving and researching - we bought the Outback and could not be happier.
13666	The Outback rides nice, handles like a car in traffic, but has ground clearance and interior space of a crossover or SUV.
13667	Quick acceleration, esp.
13673	Overall, this is the best Outback I've owned.
13674	The styling is classy, the mileage is very good, and the eyesight feature is fantastic.
13675	It rides well on long trips and can carry a lot of stuff.
13680	The quality of this car combined with its utilitarian nature is outstanding.
13681	I can not wait for the first snowfall.
13682	In snow, it out performs my Jeep Wrangler.
13683	THIS IS THE PERFECT CAR!!
13693	Probably one of the best Vehicles we have ever owned.
13694	Consumer Reports states Subaru is 2nd best... and We can deifnitely see it in our Subaru's!
13695	Only Lexus comes close but a difference of almost 20K!
13705	Love this car so far.
13710	They think of everything for those of us in snow country.
13715	Excellent vehicle and value for the money.

13737	Great value but at performance sake.

13748	Excellent transportation for the dog and me!
13759	Excellent multi-purpose vehicle.
13764	Car runs great.
13765	I'd buy it again.
13770	I had considered a Toyota & Honda models with this vehicle and the valve of not paying extra for all wheel drive, and the excellent reviews by the Automotive editorials sold me.
13775	Love this car our first suv, and I only wish that I had gotten one before, but am happy with this one,
13787	We love this car overall.
13788	It seems to get a lot of negative reviews but the motor has a lot of power, it has a very attractive interior and is built in the USA.
13789	What more can you ask for from an suv?
13796	The car has delivered on all expectations.
13797	The interior is comfortable and roomy.
13803	Great car.
13804	I think it has the potential to become a new Subaru flagship.
13810	Fell safe in it, great looking crossover !!!
13815	This sporty crossover is a great find at this price point.
13820	Overall this is a great vehicle.
13821	I love it.
13822	Wish it drove a bit quieter and was a bit quicker merging into highway traffic, but the tradeoff is great MPG and if those are the biggest complaints, I think it's a keeper!
13827	Handles extremly well in all weather conditions (including snow), easy to drive and park both in urban/forest environment.
13828	The luggage room is enough for most of the family trips.
13829	Easy to handle and safe in case you have small children.
13834	A great small sized crossover with appealing looks.
13835	Great roomy interior with very good seating.
13841	We love this vehicle so far,our first AWD,and it has avery short turning radius and the ride is food for a small SUV
13846	Regardless of the few   flaws  , I absolutely love it!
13847	I have no regrets, I actually can't wait for this winter to drive it and know I'll be safe and able to get down our unplowed roads with ease.
13852	I'd recommend this car over any similar car in it's class or pit it against any luxury vehicle offering a similar set-up.
13864	Great looks, good handling, great gas mileage all of the bells and whistles.
13865	Options that are easy to use and placed on the dash just right and where you expect them to be.
13866	What is not to like??
13871	Buy one!
13872	:)

13909	Love this car
13914	love it!!!!!
13919	We've only had the Crosstrek for a few weeks and it is Awesome.
13920	It is fun to drive, has enough power to do what's needed.
13921	Before we purchased we looked at many compact Crossovers and to get AWD with the features of the Crosstrek would cost $1000's more.
13927	So far this has been a fun car.
13929	In heavy rain it handled excellent.
13935	This is my second subie so far my wife and I like this vehicle no major complaints , we love Subaru very dependable rides.Best manufacture of vehicles , number one in consumer report,IIHS top safety pick.

14021	A great little truck!
14026	Definitely the best value out there for the money....Believe me i took my time on this purchase.Not happy that other brands want to give you a 36 months warranty and,then sell you a $2,600.00 extended warranty.
14031	I would buy it again!
14036	Very capable and competent small SUV.
14037	Worthy of a try.
14042	Good value for money, no major problems, good off-road handling.

14075	My wife and I love this car and I expect to see them more and more on the road.
14080	This car is simply AMAZING!
14081	This car truly feels like a high-end German car, in that everything works together and makes you feel connected to the car.
14082	Its steering is tight and communicative, its handling is razor-sharp, and its overall feel is positive
14087	As a car enthusiast, engineer and master automobile technician, I I have driven and/or owned almost every car imaginable.I wanted an inexpensive AWD vehicle that would get reasonable fuel economy.
14093	I know some reviews mention  it lacks horse power.Please!.....Who says 89 gasoline and a K&N air filter can't be used?
14095	I love this thin
14100	Best car you've never heard of
14105	You can't buy this car anymore, but if you can find a good used one it's a unbelievable value.

14133	It's quick, and nimble.
14134	I was taking 35 mile per hour curves, at about 60, and never had a second thought.
14136	it has a feel of a much more expensive auto, from the soft interior touch spots to the way it handles and drives.
14142	Great package if you want a car that is not around every corner like a subaru/ honda/ toyota.
14143	Just a shame nobody knows more about this car.
14149	I always smile when it is the Kizashi's turn to get me around.
14156	I bought mine from a dealership with a Chrysler connection..
14162	Race to a Suzuki dealer to get one before they're gone, for good.

14528	Great vehicle!
14531	Almost Scary how well it does off road and how smooth everything feels.
14537	Overall I'm really happy with all aspects of this vehicle.
14538	Dealer told me that this 5th gen 4runner is back to it's roots of being a 4runner and no longer on the path to family CUV like previous generations, I think I agree with this statelment.
14544	I loive this vehicle.
14545	I perfer to drive it over my MB GL450
14555	Love it!

14571	Great truck that really holds its value, parts are abundant and reasonable price.
14572	In addition very cheap to maintain runs off unleaded gasoline.
14577	Excellent vehicle for off road use or on road touring.
14578	Lots of people notice, and get questions, wow, what is that?
14583	We have a 1992 Camry XLE with 150,000 miles, never misses a beat.
14585	Toyota has never let us down.
14591	keep in mind that i use my 4runner for boat hauling, fly fishing adventures, snowy ski trips, AND downtown business meetings.
14597	So far best SUV I have owned!
14610	Braking is fast and secure, but yo
14615	This is the SUV that I have been looking for the last 3 years.
14616	The Explorer and Jeep were incredible vehicles, but I wanted a true truck to handle anything I can throw at it.
14621	Great SUV, still body on frame, so it will do what others would LIKE to be able to do, and still do it in style.
14622	Trail edition if you are serious off roader, SR5 if you are not looking to spend money, and Limited if you want it all.
14627	Would highly recommend to others.
14632	Real SUV
14637	A great car!
14642	I think that Toyota did a great job on the redesign, as I never considered purchasing the previous models because they were just too stodgy.
14647	This car is a bargain.
14648	Nicer than the Lexus and costs less.
14649	Fantastic ride with a comfortable interior.

15647	The 2013 is by far a superior product although I miss my 2005 for other reasons.
15654	To be honest the Prius is the only car I considered.
15667	This is my second Prius, the first one I drove for 7 years with no problems.

15726	Great economical car
15731	Buy it.
15736	Great car, probably most economical option for a small car when figured with the hybrid fuel savings.
15742	Overall, you will find owners are much happier with this car than the magazines and reviewing  professionalshave graded it.

16048	Lots of new features from the old Rave 4
16053	Great handling
16058	A lot of car for the value.

16113	Great bang for the buck, I almost bought a Subaru and hadn't even considered the RAV4.
16114	One drive is all it took.

16178	Typical automaker new age approach.
16185	Has all I need for lifestyle driving, both in-town and on the road.
16191	The Sienna has the best reliability, acceleration, build quality, and better bang for the buck than the Odyssey.
16192	The engine is refined, and provides outstanding performance comp
16199	The Sienna was not lacking in power, and it handles as you would expect a minivan to.
16205	An excellant choice for a minivan!!!!!!!!!!
16210	I would rate the Sienna tops for a minivan.
16215	It's a luxury van that will do what it was intended to do.
16216	In style.
16217	Try it you'll like it!
16222	Rides nicely , comfy spacious really nice van.
16227	One of the best Van on the market
16232	I have owned Minivans since they first came into the market,I must say we have come a long ways from when it started.
16233	I have no hesitation in recommending the Sienna, given it's quality and the history of Toyota reliability.
16234	another plus- Service from ou
16251	The things that I find wrong with this vehicle can be fixed and seem to be minor.

16261	I liked the look and feel of the in
16275	Nice looking, solid truck.
16276	I got the TRD sports package and love the way it looks.
16281	If you are looking for solid reliable transportation, and need to tow 5,000lbs, its tough to beat this truck.
16286	I wanted a fuel sipping truck that could still tow, carry and be reliable for a long time and i feel i hit the nail on the head!
16291	Very satisfying vehicle for my use except for not having intermittent wipers.
16298	Best truck I have ever owned !
16303	Great truck, looks good, drives good and will last forever
16308	I personally couldn't be more pleased with my new truck.
16309	This vehicle is truely worth the price!
16314	I highly recommend this if you want a pickup but dont need a big pickup like an F150 or any of that size pickups.
16319	Overall I consider the PreRunner a well made truck.
16320	Lots of features that others don't have, but the ones that it does have could have been improved to keep customer in mind.
16325	If you are looking for a good mid-size truck with great resale value.
16326	And has been proven to be very reliable, I would choosea Tacoma.
16331	Excellent truck.
16332	Great resale value
16337	I like this vehicle very much, it takes time to get use to the size of it.
16338	even though I got screwed on the car trade which we all do I would highly recommend this vehicle

16344	If you want a truck that's got all the bells and whistles, is realiable, gets good fuel economy and can still tow a fair amount this is the truck for you.
16345	I still have a soft spot for the ford eco-boost how
16350	Traded my 2005 Tacoma Double Cab 4x4 Long Bed SR5 I bought brand new off the lot in OCT 2005 for a 2013 Tacoma Double Cab 4x4 Long Bed TRD Sport brand new off the lot in FEB 2013.Reason (My Opinions) why I gave the following categories a score of 10.Styl
16355	ONE WORD - BEST !!!!!!
16360	Great truck tows my implement trailer (lawnmowers) like theres nothing there.
16361	I would recommend this truck to anyone that needs a truck and wants to get decent mileage.
16362	I don't know how anyone would be disappointed.
16367	Awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!!
16372	Perfect truck For me!
16377	I LOVE IT
16382	Great truck for the money, traded in a 2011 scion tc which i bought new as well and it was the best idea i have had.
16383	The car was fantastic but owning a tacoma is just something peopel should experience.
16384	Great syle, great milage, good off road handling, a
16389	I feel like I'm riding in a car.
16390	Never would have thought a truck could feel so refined.
16391	Traded in my 2011 scion tc for this truck, and has a 10x smoother ride than the tc.
16396	great, great great.
16401	Great truck for the money and performance
16418	I would dare to say this is the best 4x4 on the road period.
16419	The big three need to take notice as this truck will out perform them
16424	Great vehicle.
16425	I would recommend it to anyone who wants a great truck.
16430	Unlike the person that thinks this is an expensive vehicle to maintain, it is actually cheaper (free for the first 25K miles) than our Honda civic and Jeep was/is to maintain.
16446	Love my Tundra I traded a 2012 Tundra 4.6 4x2 for it only lost about 1 mpg.
16447	The 5.7 I have now is much more powerful.
16448	I will probably never buy anything other then a Toyota.
16449	Gas mileage runs from 16.5 to 18.5.
16455	Awesome buy, would recommend to anyone!
16460	Even though the truck is a bit outdated, build quality makes up for its short coming.
16461	If you can.
16463	Expect to see new a revised frame, new engines, and better MPG.
16468	Great truck!
16473	Excellent truck, very comfortable and great looks.
16480	I'm pleased; no government motors in my near future!
16485	Rock-solid truck built to last.
16490	If you are looking to buy a truck, do yourself a favor and take a look at the Tundra.
16495	Had hoped to do better with gas mileage, but vehicle performs within advertised range.
16496	Be prepared for a firm ride...corners well, handles like cars that have a much lower stance.
16497	Good looks, practical, performs well, and durable.
16498	Would recommend.
16510	I believe this is a very good vehicle for someone who needs the versatility of an SUV without sacrificing the gas milage and handling of a larger vehicle.
16512	For me, it has exceeded my expectations.
16513	I will definitel
16524	Given what I paid for it and the subsequent low cost to own this car (insurance, registration, fuel costs, etc.)
16525	I am so glad I purchased it.
16526	I would do it all over
16536	Just liked the way it drove.
16537	The car had excell
16542	If your looking for style, comfort, and something a little different than all the other sedans on the road, check out the Venza.
16547	The cost of ownership of this car has been amazing.
16548	For the price I paid and what I got for my money I could not be happier.
16549	My insurance is very reasonable.
16550	Toyota's 24-month maintenance free program is great; something I never got from Ford or GM.
16564	Like it better than a Mercedes SUV.We love this car.
16569	LOVE IT...................
16574	The styling, cavernous interior cargo with seats folding flat at the flip of a lever, excellent gas mileage for it's size (I4-AWD) and Toyota reliability won me over in spite of this one major downside...I wish I could have gotten the sunroof too!
16580	I would definetly buy another.
16581	Dealer Service has been Excellent; Five Star
16586	I would definetly buy another.
16587	Dealer Service has been Excellent; Five Star
16592	Will recommend buying
16597	The 2013 Venza is what it should have been from the beginning.
16598	It is a great looking, great riding wagon that flies in the face of the station wagons of yore.
16599	Stylish with aggressive 20 inch wheels, the 2013 Venza makes owning such a class of car fun, so
16604	I had my 2013 since Aug. of 2012 and do not regret buying this vehicle.
16605	I looked at a lot of CrossOvers, the Venza stood out above the rest.
16612	I had a 2010 Venza v-6, AWD which I like very much.
16615	I would buy this car again.
16620	love it!

16636	I like it, I would buy it again.
16637	My friends make fun of my little   clown car but whatever....I walk away with more money in my wallet.
16638	I am happy with it.
16643	Overall is a good economic, reliable vehicle for someone like me who can not afford an expensive car.
16644	I will purchase another one if i move to a summer climate city.
16649	very stylish and i would recommend this to newly weds
16654	I own a denim blue and get compliments and thumbs up quite often when driving down the street.
16655	The style is great.
16656	Everyone who drives it loves it !
16662	It was my primary vehicle.
16671	Its great, fun and enjoyable to drive
16676	The TDI is a surprise gutsy performer.
16677	15000 miles and no service problems.
16682	I had a bug in the 60's and do not know why it took me so long to buy another.
16683	Love the German influence and technology
16688	AWESOME :)
16693	I love my beetle and would buy another one today.
16698	Handles a lot better than I thought it would.
16703	Great car.
16708	ALWAYS WANTED ONE..LOVE THE RE-DESIGN.
16709	I HAVE A 2013 CONVERTIBLE..LOVE IT !!!!
16714	The best looking convertible and fun to drive
16719	Fun to drive, even TDI is fast.
16720	People love the tan over red combo and it gets lots of thumbs up.
16722	But mostly it is fun to drive, easy and fast to put top up or down and more room than you would think.
16728	Excellent new design and performance!
16729	With the Turbo, eats the mountain roads.
16730	Good gas mileage too, if one can resist putting the foot down to hear the turbo.
16731	Very comfortable interior too.
16736	It's my first German vehicle (previously owned Acura, Toyota, Nissan, and Jeep) and I LOVE IT!
16737	Trust me, the car shines best at night when all the lights are on with the panoramic moon roof tilted up.
16743	Grear%20Car.%20Better%20than%20my%202011%20CC.
16753	Awsome car.
16754	Many improvements over my 2010 cc.
16759	For the price I think its a great car, looks great will turn heads and nice ride, does not have some features that I felt should be included but over all the CC is a good deal.
16764	Overall, a great car, for whatever the driving demands.
16769	im satisfied with my purchase overall
16779	awesome love this car have had 2 days
16789	Best bang for the bucks...especially if you can get your hands on a 2013 this christmas...
16794	I have owned a lot of cars, from Hondas to Acuras to Saabs, and this is without question the most fun to drive, best looking, quietest car I have ever owned.
16800	This is my first German car... so far I liked it style and engine performance...
16805	Love driving the car and the RNS 510 nav system is wonderful...love the sound system the way it plays Jazz on a long commute home or road trip.
16816	I was sold on the appearance without the price of a Mercedes.
16821	An excellent car, much improved over the previous, already-good 2010 model.
16822	Would recommend to anyone who wants a great car at a sensible price.
16827	I researched tons of cars in the same class, and I'm completely thrilled with my purchase.
16828	This car turns heads - in-fact I had someone at a gas station tell me what a wonderful job Mercedes has done with this car .
16837	First European purchase and I'm glad I did...
16842	very nice car to have.
16847	Great value (for what I was looking for in a car).I have put over 30,000 miles on my CC and still enjoy it as much as day one.
16852	This car is like taking a european vacation without the expense of a long flight.
16857	This is a very nice automobile.
16858	For just two people and our small dog it should be a car that we will enjoy for years to come.
16859	Also, the dealership we dealt with has made owning the car very enjoyable, and that can't be said for some of the dealerships w
16871	It is an amazing car!
16876	I gave this car rating of 9's and 10's.
16877	I am very surprised I don't see more of them on the road.
16880	The EOS won han
16885	car is living up to very high expectations so far
16891	Our other car is a E class Bluetec and this is just as nice to drive.
16896	Very happy with this vehicle.
16897	Would recommend it to anyone.

16961	Great overall car.
16968	This car is also way under rated on miles per gallon.
16969	Rated also at 42 ave on highway we have got up to 53.
16980	Quality car as opposed to the US made Jetta which ses cheaper components in a number of areas.
16986	If you want a practical yet exhilarating driving experience without the boy racer cheapness that a lot of cars have these days than this car is the one for you.
16987	I felt like I didn't have to give up or sacrifice anything like I would have had to do with o
16992	I've had quicker, better handling cars (Porsche 911), more luxurious cars (Acura Legend), and more economical cars (VW Beetle), but this is a very good blend of the best features of each.
16999	I have owned other VWs in the past, but in 2013 VW has greatly improved the quality of the GTI inside and out.
17000	The car is a joy to drive at any speed, and with an average MPG of 34 MPG, I am a very happy owner.
17001	In general, I lo
17006	Volkswagen continues to create practical and inspiring GTI hatch that fits like a glove and handles like an obedient puma .
17009	in one artful, elegant, and wonderfully understated package.
17010	Love the Laguna wheels available in 2013.
17015	It's a super fun car to drive: sporty & quick, but easy to get along with day-to-day.
17016	It's like getting an Audi for 30% off!
17017	I almost look forward to driving to work every morning!
17024	It is a great car for someone who wants a smaller, practical hatchback that performs very well, gets 32mpg on the highway, and has an interior that embarrasses many $35-45,000 cars.
17030	As the old adage goes:  It's funner to drive a slow car fast than a fast car slow.While the GTI is no rocketship, it is fairly quick.
17031	Handling is superb.
17032	Braking is stellar.
17033	Comfort is outstanding for a car this size.
17034	Note in Europe these are premium c
17039	Nothing can surpass VW's DSG.
17040	Such a Joy to drive without the hassle of always having to shift in traffic.
17045	I'm very happy with my GTI.
17046	I have no complaints none at all.
17053	Ive owned a 2010 manual and loved it, the only problem in 30k miles was a faulty tire pressure sensor.
17054	I love the timeless plaid seats that hug you as accelorate through corners.
17060	Overall it is a great car that is fun and practical at the same time.
17066	Jetta seats one more than Mercedes CLS550.
17067	Mit Jetta, transport von bis zu f?nf Personen alle ?ber dem Platz auf vier Reifen mit einem Verbrennungsmotor - wunderbar!
17077	I kind of don't want to let people in on the secret diesel society, but it is amazing.
17080	Compared to my last vehicle which got 30 mpg, the 5-10% e
17085	Fun ride, it looks great.
17086	Never been a Volkswagen fan before but if they keep up the fresh designs and great performance I may stay one for life.
17088	Only thing that comes close was a well packaged
17093	Have had absolutely no problems at 10 months and 11,000 miles.
17098	The Jetta S. 2.0 5 speed manual is a great vehicle if you don't have to drive up hills or start on a hill or carry 4 adults in the vehicle.
17103	It is worthy for the price.
17109	Go get it and you will love it.
17114	Great combination of comfort, handling, economy, and an awesome cross-country cruiser.
17124	I love driving a manual transmission and the great gas mileage.
17126	Its great, fun transportation.
17131	I love this car!
17132	Haven't been this happy with a car for a long time.
17137	It is my first family car but it does not look like one!
17142	I really like my car!
17155	Much better than a Prius any day of the week.
17160	The best bang for the buck!

17171	The best car in its segment at a low price.
17172	The best deal you can get.
17182	Great car for the price!
17187	Im super happy with my 2013 jetta.
17188	It drives excellent, I got a great deal on it and I look forward to driving it everday!
17193	This is the ultimate driving machine regardless what other makes think!
17198	Buy one
17203	Not many station wagons can match the versatility, fuel mileage, and fun factor of the Sportwagen TDI.
17208	Good car.
17209	Do not regret the purchase.
17214	highly recommend for low cost ownership and high reliability
17219	Excellent vehicle.
17220	Very happy with purchase so far.
17226	), fuel efficient (43+ MPG over 2375 miles thus far in 65% highway use) and nice looking wagen.
17231	Great, great car.
17232	Glad I bought it and would do so again for sure.
17238	Excellent and economical car.
17239	I have the Diesel: I average 42.5 MPG, on highway driving, without being slower the flow of traffice I average 43-48MPG.
17244	Best vehicle I have ever owned!
17254	A great car in town and on the road.
17255	The dogs love their own area to hang out in.
17260	If they ever allow the e-ron Diesel engine to be sold in the USA will trade up to it the day it's available.
17266	I always have 300lb or more of cargo plus my 250lb and still get 40mpg.
17267	I looked around a lot before purchasing and couldn't find anything even close to the storage/mpg of the diesel sportwagen.
17273	Great car, i would buy another one .
17278	The SportWagen has the best of everything.
17280	Also owned three Passat's as well.
17281	Have enjoyed all of them.

17287	This is a wonderful wagon, great size and performance.

17315	Everything as good or better than advertized!
17316	Not one complaint.
17321	I absolutely love the car.
17322	As far as value goes, I couldn't beat it.
17323	Got an excellent deal on it.My monthly fuel savings covers the car payment.
17324	The rear seat is super roomy and the trunk is huge.
17331	Overall an excellent car!
17346	The best mid size family(?)
17348	Luxurious enough and German to compete with cars that are more expensive, even the rich cousin the Audi A4/A6.
17358	If you commute or do a lot of highway driving,the TDI is the vehicle for you.
17359	If you only drive around town and put very little miles on in a year then the TDI would be overkill, stick with the gas model.
17364	The Passat has many of the luxury sedan features, space and comforts that we test drove for a fraction of the price.
17370	Working for the last day; so hoping it was faulty fuses vice a ground in the electrical system.Overall Review: Have h

17435	Terrific vehicle for commuting & long (500+ mile per day) trips.
17440	overall very nice to drive and am considering buying it.
17445	Overall, the Passat TDI is a well made car that I wish was cheaper to offset the higher diesel pump price and the lack of a backup camera and USB port.
17446	The radio with XM was really nice and the room in the car cannot be beat!
17447	On the road, the car is resp
17452	quiet the driving experience and vw will have a solid 10

17528	The car has many great features and I got it for 4k under list which sealed the deal.
17533	Love it!!
17538	Should have purchased this car years ago.
