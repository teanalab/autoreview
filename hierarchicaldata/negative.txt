57	Would not buy this, I would stick to the Ford F-150.

119	Buyers remorse, this truck has major electrical issues.
145	Owned for 22 days been able to drive it 10 of those day because it is in the dealership for repairs.
146	Can not drive to far from home in case it breaks down waiting for back ordered parts.
147	I traded 2011 Ram wish I bought a Ram or a Ford.
148	I am not impressed
212	Would not buy again, I compromised on the power hoping for the better mpg, well it delivered on the lack of horsepower, but came up short on EPA mpg ratings (I get about 20 combined mpg, and have never topped 25 mpg on a complete highway trip after now
229	Overall I would reccommend that if one is interested in this vehicle don't even look at the small engine, you will waste your money.

231	I live where there are many hills and the 4
236	I researched this vehicle for 2 years before buying the 2012 SLT V4.
237	I was looking for something more fuel efficient and stylish than my 2008 Trailblazer.

291	Really like this vehicle if they could just figure out what is wrong with the collision alert system.
314	I figure that it is a trade off...if you want good gas mileage, buy a compact or a hybrid.
315	If you want something more comfortable, but lower gas mileage, the terrain fits the bill.
321	It reminds me of the classic station-wagon, a sadly defunct class of cars that were a good compromise between a sedan and a van.Don't expect sports sedan handling or acce

413	Cannot kick on the power or the performance.
414	Traded my Envoy for this vehicle just for the gas mileage and for the noise reduction on the highway.
421	Previously I had a Suburban and was just tired herding it around town and parking.
433	Test drive the other vehicles in this class just so your mind is at ease when you decide to purchase the Terrain!

492	I would to see a litte more HP.. GMC you did a good job onm this truck and how to use it.
498	However, I think GMC needs to add the guidelines with the rear back up camera.
499	Most vehicles have this feature when they have the backup camera for the vehicle.
500	I would think this would be an added safety feature of the veh
505	I hope the makers consider correcting the problems I mentioned above.

4135	We narrowed the choice down to several cars, specifically the Sonata, Altima, Camry, Optima, and Acc
4146	I really liked the Nissan Altima but was not impressed with the warranty and price.
4163	I have owned a couple dozen over my lifetime from Jaguars to Kias.
4173	We switched from a Nissan Altima 3.5 (10 years 180K) to the Hyundai Sonata which was a difficult decision.
4174	We have put about 5K miles on the car including trips and couldn't be happier with our purchase.
4179	The Sonata is at a crossroads as to where it wants to go from here.
4180	It has been floating around at near the top of its class for awhile now but, when will see the next step forward?
4204	From 1-10 I give it a 2.

4573	With the price of gasoline today a car with lousy gas mileage gets downgraded badly by this problem.
