652	Great car  Sport Mode lLove the economy of the car and the price is cheap for the quality and reliability.Microfiber seats are great.
653	Need more travel on the drivers side.Car should have heated side mirrors.
659	I took more than one year to buy new car and in between I was going through numerous reviews, Test Rides and friends experiences Whoever bought any car brand in 1st week they were blown away but after some time you can see them back to reality.

731	I've had great success with Honda in the past.
737	Hard to believe its a Honda and not a Lexus.
742	Great handling, blue-tooth, back-up camera leather wraped steering wheel189 hp...
748	We've been buying Honda's and Acura's since the late 1980's and this is the best Accord yet.
753	This is my first new car and I absolutely love it.
755	The stock rims are fantastic I have the black on black Sport trim.
763	It is just the best midsize car around for daily driving, long term ownership, value, all that good stuff is here.
773	Superior to my last Accord, 2011 SE.
783	Came from a 350hp Subaru and was concerned that the 185ph I4 engine would not be enough power for me.
789	I would tell people about my car
794	This car fits our needs like a glove, yet is great lookingj, sporty and fun to drive.
795	I am 6'-2and am comfortable riding in the back - so with one seven year old son, this car will meet our needs for a long time.
807	You can not beat the resale value of this mid sized sedan.
813	I LOVE THIS CAR.
814	IT'S SMART AND AFFORDABLE WITH LOTS OF COOL, 'USEFULL', TECHNOLOGIES.
825	Just purchased the 2013 Honda Civic LX auto and absolutely love it.

840	The interior has a vastly superior feel than the base model.
845	Excellent gas mileage, beautiful exterior and interior updates, excellent handling and standard features.
846	This vehicle is a great value and very fun to drive.
853	I just went from a 2010 Civic DX L to a 2013 Civic LX and I have to confess that I am surprised by all the new standard additions made to these cars.
873	However, I chose style over economy.
884	This is the first car I have ever owned that does not feel like i paid too much for, it has everything i need and then some at the right price.
897	I just had this car for a week, and I am happy I chose it over the Prius C, which I had also considered.
928	Very Nice Car for drive in the Big City.
972	I think the consumer reports score is way too low..It must be for the 2012 not the 2013....For the money not much out there to beat in with style , performance, tech, and mileage.....
977	I love this car.
978	The power is just right for its size and I am comfortable in the interior, I don't feel cramped.
1011	I am very satisfied with my Civic.

1096	It sits just high enough off the ground that it does not hurt my knees gettin
1101	We really like our 2013 CT.
1102	It is well made, comfortable driving (especially on long road trips), We get a number of people noticing the vehicle and make favorable comments.
1109	Fun car to drive and very dependable!
1110	Mine is 3+ years old!
1115	Have not felt this way about a car since my very first one.
1116	Love driving this crosstour!
1121	BUY THE CAR!
1136	This is the best overall car I've ever owned, and I've owned Lexus and Mazda in the past.
1138	PS Your review did not give me the option to select 2010, but our car is a 2010!
1144	handles great in new England weather and on dry pavement.
1151	I traded in a Lexus GS300 for the crosstour, mostly because I need more cargo room.
1152	I didn't want a full size SUV since I like the characteristics of a sporty sedan.
1154	Plus, I did not lose any of the luxury f
1174	Great Vehicle!
1180	It has the reliabilty of a Honda, saftey factors a plus, comfortable, smooth, pleasure to drive, easy access getting in and out, doesnt feel like a truck or a bumpy sports car, feels like a magical cross, drives like a car, the rear window u
1193	My overall review is that this is an excellent automobile and would recommend it to anyone looking for a stylish all-around auto.
1198	I love it!!
1203	Just a great car to own and drive!
1223	Handles well, the V6 has enough power to get up to highway speed from ramps and into the flow of higher speed traffic.
1225	Room for taller people in front and rear.
1226	Ease of using the rear cargo area.
1238	highly recommend this vehicle
1243	This vehicle is reliable and meets all my needs.
1245	I tested all popular models and this one won out.
1250	This is the second Honda CR-V we have owned.
1257	Highly recommended.
1262	I droved comfortable sport cars and coupes prior to buying this CRV, so it is very uncomortable to sit upright.
1269	Having issues with the Tire pressure warning light.
1270	It has come on 5 times it about two months, back to the dealer 3 times, no solution.
1271	Honda America will inform me when a computer fix can be done.
1272	Very unhappy driving with the light on........ Review I
1277	Great car.
1283	Excellent car for the money.
1289	I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who is looking for a high quality, versatile, family vehicle.
1294	Good for use around town, but don't take it on a trip unless you want a back ache and ringing in your ears.
1304	very stylish,easy to drive
1309	We were concerned that switching from our Honda Accord EX-V6 to the Honda CR-V would cost us more to operate..
1310	But we were pleasantly surprised that our CR-V actually gets better mileage than our Accord..
1320	I love driving again!!!
1329	This is my 5th Honda after 3 Civics and a Pilot EX-L AWD.
1337	Is excellent for running around town and short trips down the interstate.
1340	had the cr-v for 1 month and found no flaws yet.
1351	I highly recommend this SUV.
1356	Much better then my 2007.

1384	This is my 4th generation of CR-V and it's getting better everytime Honda redesigns it.
1390	Love it, will buy another.
1400	I'm a bachelor, so the two seats are fine with me; but may not be for others.
1405	I would recommend this car to everyone who asks me.
1406	It's great to drive.
1407	Handles great on wet roads.
1412	I'm so happy I bought the CRZ in February.
1413	It's one amazing looking car that's oh-so-fun to drive.
1414	As a lone commuter, like almost everyone else on the road, the two-seater CRZ has been perfect for me.
1425	The ability to think like that is always a joy to behlod
1430	This is my first SUV and I love it!
1433	It is easy to park and has a small turning radius.
1442	I don't have to twist my back up for access.
1450	it's a really great practical auto if you own you will see
1460	I bought this new at the end of January 2011.
1463	Very reliable.
1464	It feels safe, but it does have a high profile.Overall, a good buy.
1477	People have frequently asked me how I like my car and I probably bore them to tears extolling the virtues of the Honda Element.
1478	I have put very little money into this car other than the normal wear and tear type things.
1483	Spent only about $1000 in 9 years and 178000 miles since 2003
1493	ALL GREAT FEATURES
1498	This is a car that I would buy again but probably won't have to because of HONDA'S record of durabilaty.
1503	A car I would recommend highly...lot's of interior space...good mpg....attractive design in the sport package...car is a lot of fun to drive and has all the features I needed for a commuter car and it's peace of mind because it's a Honda.
1508	I've owned only Honda cars for 35 years.
1509	Wouldn't even consider buying anything else.
1510	I love my new Honda Fit.
1525	nice car, fun to drive, great gas mileage with 5 speed manual
1530	Great oil change and schedule services at Honda dealer for saving time and less stress.
1540	Not perfect, but pretty amazing.
1541	Like it better than civic.
1547	We love our little Fit.
1548	My wife loves minivans and the fit is like a mini mini mini van.
1556	Great car will have it forever and when the motor goes out you can put in a bigger honda motor.
1570	9.5 overall.
1581	When I bought the fie.t, I never imagined the real worth of this vehicle, People want to buy from me.
1583	Oh, i own a 2011 model awsome little car immings.
1589	did i say i love my insight?
1607	Should not pass up this car ... worth the money and then some
1628	Overall, I'm very happy with the Honda.
1630	It's safe and feels stable in adverse conditions.
1635	I'm reviewing an older 2008 model, because not a lot has changed with this vehicle since then.
1644	I would recommend this truck to everyone I know because of the smooth ride and storage.
1651	My truck fits my needs like a glove.
1653	My truck goes through snow like a knife through hot butter.
1659	love it I have owned 2 of them and will buy a third
1667	And it was a fair price!
1674	It is a very handy truck for a person who occasionally hauls and tows but likes the feel and riding position of a truck.
1675	It isn't so big you can't park it, but not so small you can't haul anything.
1676	So far, it is j
1681	So far no issues with the truck.
1689	First time I owned a 2008.
1690	It was not prep well but I think it was more that the dealer wanted to dump this unit since it had been sitting on their lot for 11 months.
1697	I am a ASE Master technician, and with working on All makes and models, THIS VEHICLE IS ONE OF THE BEST!
1706	Dealer gave me a great deal on my tradein.
1707	For the money, this is a great car ( so far).
1712	Longevity will be the best determination of what I sum up this car to be, but with the warranty it shouldn't be an issue
1721	BBQ or mildew
1726	Overall we are very satisfied with the Azera and would probably buy it again.
1747	This car is like lexus + benz from hyundai
1757	just great
1762	Really Happy with choice.
1764	Really didn't want $4K primer package - big hot sunroof, hard 19tires, and few other toys.
1777	Would buy again.
1783	Better than the Lexus ES I traded in and $10,000 cheaper than a new Lexus ES.Incredibly spacious.
1784	I am 6'2tall and never have to move my seat up to make room for passengers in the back.Can't imagine why Hyundai doesn't do anything
1789	I thought my Sonata was a great car, but the Azera goes way beyond it in offering a quiet, luxurious ride; beautiful, head-turning styling; and an incredible array of tech gadgets and gizmos that I marvel at every time I use them.
1795	This is my third Azera, from 2008 to 2010 until now a 2012.
1796	I am so impressed with this car that I bragged about it at the 2013 Philly Auto show also there is not enough room given here to go into detail about my satisfying experience with Azera.
1810	The LED lights are fantastic as well as the panoramic roof, cooled and heated seats.
1826	The more she drives it the better she likes it.
1837	My second Azera , have a 2007..no problems after 75K ...hope this 2013 gives me the same reliability.
1847	Great purchase for the money.
1854	The value to me was with all of the options, this car is LESS money than ALL of the competitors wi
1859	Hands down best car I have ever owned.
1868	The vehicle has plenty of cabin room and cargo space.
1869	I compare my Azera to my previously owned Lin
1874	I love my new car.
1885	I love this car, once we test drove it I had to have it.
1886	Got a great deal and for all the bells and whistles on this car the Avalon would have cost well over $40,000.
1887	Great car for the cost, looking at purchasing a second one.
1892	Best large car out there, and at a reasonable price with great warranty.
1903	For the price, dependability and features, this car exceeds all of my expectations!
1908	I have owned many cars in the last 40 years but this is the best automobile ever.
1909	I had to put it in the garage as it is so fun to drive.
1916	Great car at a great price, best value for the dollar.
1928	Best value for the money.
1934	The Accent has come a long way over the last 5 years and I would rececommend this car to anyone looking for a car in this price range.
1971	It's everything I expected.
1981	I bought the Russian version (called Hyundai Solaris), because it's not sold in other European countries.
1995	The Accent is the one
2001	after a couple years i'd like to revisit this review and see what i have to day then.
2007	I travel mostly highway miles, a commuter car, so its puuurfect for me; and after a two and half months of ownership, who needs a elantra or a sonata?
2012	the car has a bulletproof engine and transmission somewhat basic suspention could be a little stiffer, but steering is nice and tight needs a little practice to get it to go straight, this car has the capability to last a very long time you just need to
2022	I have had my 2012 Accent since July 2011, no problems and it rides well.In the winter traction is sometimes a problem....but usually when other cars also have the same problems
2043	I enjoy driving this car but if I had it to do over I would buy another Elantra.
2054	All in all I like the car.
2055	Hyundai has a good reputation and I get over 40 miles per gallon on trips.
2062	Have been running a test with this tank of gas and keeping car at 6
2070	I own a KAI Soul, also.
2075	bought this car after reading reviews and test drove looking at the MPG listed on the sticker.
2076	Well my mileage has been lousy and I complained to Hyundai corporate and all they are doing in giving me the run around sending a speedsheet to track my mileag
2089	Overall, we love with car.
2092	In the city where we do most of our driving, we avg 20-25mpg.
2093	We bought this car because my wife was expecting.
2106	should have bought a Subaru or Honda civic for the price vs. mileage.
2111	Much worse than I planned for and very poor at being honest about it all.
2126	I bought a 2013 base model with Auto Transmission.
2135	I GET EMAILS, SERVICE REMINDERS, AND LET'S NOT FORGET 100K WARRANTY!AS A CERTIFIED MASTER AUTO TECH, I CHOSE THIS CAR FOR THE REPUTATION, VALUE AND DEPENDABILITY
2140	I bought this car after reading recommendations from consumer reports.
2141	I am not impressed overall with Hyundai and will probably not buy another one.
2147	DO NOT BUY THIS CAR!!!
2148	I have owned the 2013 Elantra Coupe since 07/2012 & am already scouring the internet to find a replacement...anybody got a suggestion???
2171	I have been very impressed with my 2013 Hyundai Elantra.
2173	My daughter just bought one as well and she loves it.
2180	I also have a Sonata Limited and this car is equally fun to drive for a lot less cost.
2185	I'd give this car a perfect ten if I had the engine broken in but to be fair I gave the acceleration a 9 because I haven't put the peddle to the medal for fear of breaking in the engine incorrectly!
2186	I like this car, my wife loves it so I'm a happy camper
2202	Car drove good, gas tank runs small.
2204	Came home,drove my Honda and felt like I was driving a tank compared to the Elantra.
2216	Again, not dissapointed by buying an Elantra.
2218	With the design of the  easy to usecontrol center, my eyes are never off the road for more than a second or two.
2224	Great car for the price.
2229	This 2013 SE-COUPE M/T is probably the best small car I've ever owned!
2235	For the money I would do it again.
2247	I have just over 4000 miles on this car.
2258	I have owned Toyota and Honda vehicles and have had zero problems I am afarid to take this car on a long trip as something may break or leak.
2264	In short, I love my Elantra and intend to drive it for many years.
2271	I really like my 2013 Elantra and I'm glad I bought it.
2279	If mine is listed in the recall, I will most likely sell, and never go back to Hyundai.
2280	Service department are people who know how to exchange parts only.
2286	Just purchased new 2013 GLS.
2287	Great price and MPG.
2307	Purchased through Costco program.
2308	$25k list price, bought for $ 22k with extended warranty.Comfortable ride for 6.2' driver.
2332	I drive 40miles round trip to work 90% is freeway AND the MPG goes from 27 to 38MPG.
2334	When the grade elevates, down goes the MPG.
2340	This car rides nice with comfortable seats.
2342	nice handling and good acceleration and gets around 30 mpg not 40 mpg.
2349	Except for the visibility problem, I am happy with this car and think I picked the best of the batch according to my criteria.
2356	on the good side is the Warranty all 3 of my hyundais were bought from the same dealer NEVER a problem with service.
2363	The only thing is it is missing is less than superb drivability.
2366	But unless you're a driving enthusiast, you won't know the difference, and to th
2371	Very pleased with car!!!
2379	The steering seems to be an issue with some but you get used to it
2391	I use the cruise control a lot (even in town) to maintain and adjust speed, which also helps the mileage.
2412	I am very happy with my car.
2413	My car buying experience was very pleasant, I did not feel pressured or stressed.
2433	Great car, has all the toys my TL had, plus backup camera, keyless startup, nav system works great.
2452	I have an Elantra Coupe.
2453	It handles well, but the brakes can be touchy at times.
2454	I have had it for almost a year now, no problems to speak of yet!
2456	The air vents are alittle lower than most cars, but I got use to them pre
2467	I own the new 2006 Elandra.
2468	At less 6-year and 34K mileages, the radiator and engine died suddenly without any sign with a lot of coolant spreading and engine smoking.

3451	I have been very well served by my Genesis and recommended both the dealer and the car to others.

3706	I still catch myself looking at it when It's parked and say  that's a hot looking design
3711	For those worried about running lights, turn your lights on and leave them on all of the time, I do, they shut off autmatically.

3922	Owned for six months and 11000 miles2013 Hyundia Santa Fe front wheel drive basic package

4020	It is a very nice car to drive.
4021	Finish looks very nice as long as you do not drive it anywhere.Quality issue with finishes and Blue LinkExtremely poor customer service

4045	Very happy with my purchase.
4053	Grade kids love to ride in the sporty car with sunroof and navigation to look at.
4065	I am very pleased with my 2013 Sonata.
4066	I would recommend it to anyone......Seems like several car companies are copying the body style.
4091	nicest car i've owned , the se stance and the venitian red paint is just gorgeous !
4092	it takes corners like its on rails , it just sticks !
4116	I also drive a 2009 Genesis 4.6.
4133	My wife and I purchased this car on March 26, 2013.
4152	I like the car after driving Camry's for the last 13 years is is a refreshing difference.
4162	One of the best vehicles that I have owned.
4173	We switched from a Nissan Altima 3.5 (10 years 180K) to the Hyundai Sonata which was a difficult decision.
4187	Roomy interior, love the seat warmers as well as drink cups and the sunglasses case.
4194	THIS CAR EXCEEDS ALL OF MY EXPECTATIONS.
4220	Buy one, much better value than Accord, Camry,Altima, Malibu, or Fusion.
4255	LOVE the car, a steal for the money.
4260	Overall, I love this car!
4268	My second Hyundai, and not my last.
4275	!Also impressed by Dealership in N.L.county CT.and sales knowledge of this Fine Automobile.
4286	I'm a former Toyota owner (Solara) and after 7 years in that car I switched to the Sonata because of the value for the money.
4287	I'm very glad I did!!
4302	The car is so comfortable, and I love all the features that are offered for the price!
4318	I have no regrets at all about my decision to buy this car.
4319	Would do it again tomorrow if I needed another one.
4350	Best car I have ever owned or rode in.
4360	I had a Camry but decided to go with the Sonata this time after some thought, I believe I made the right choice.
4382	This car offers everything I need in a daily driver, family commute and sporty fun ride.
4389	We have put our first 12,000 miles in with ZERO trips to the dealer and no complaints.
4390	Quiet, solid, and smoother than silk.
4406	We have received many compliments on the look of the car and most are shocked when we say it's a Hyundai.
4429	We were going straight to the Nissan dealership but on a whim stopped by the Hyundai dealership across the street took a test drive then went straight to the office and purchased the vehicle!
4434	Have had this car (Limited) for three months.
4435	Other than minor annoyances mentioned, this has been an outstanding car.
4446	plain and simple i was impressed with the test drive and walked off the lot with my sonata 1 hour later

4459	I don't see much loss in power as compared to my BMW.
4460	It handles great, seats are comfortable and the vehicle takes long or short ride very
4476	I'm not thrilled with mine at all.
4495	I would buy another Hyundia again.
4496	This Sonata is accutally my second.
4497	I had owned a '09 Elantra beofre this and had no issues what so ever.
4509	not good so far
4514	I really love my car, it serves the purposes we bought it for and we got many features for alot less then other comparable optioned vehicles.
4521	I owned an Elantra.
4524	Salesman made me do it.
4530	and the warranty is exceptional
4535	We are a big family but we were tired of minivans.
4536	We were almost ready to by an SUV (Santa Fe/CRV) but one drive in the 2013 Sonata and we fell in love.
4541	Not a bad car for the money but I probably would have gone with something else had I done my research.
4551	Overall the car rides nice, but there are a few defect with my 2013 Sonata.
4563	This car is fine for me now but I probably would purchase a smaller vehicle next time.
4568	LOVE IT!
4588	The car is sharp -no doubt; after 7 months of ownership, I still do a double take after parking and walking away .The acceleration lag is annoying to me, but I think I am getting used to it and if you ask my wife, it has led me to better driving habbits.
4593	I seldom purchase the same make of car twice, BUT , I'll make Hyundai my first choice when I start looking for another car.
4594	I'll probably be keeping this to pass down to one of my grandchildren.
4610	I've owed Camry's, Accords, and Mercedes, andam extremely satisfied with my new 2013 Hybrid.
4615	This car is a pleasure to drive!!!!

4638	Great if you are ok with a truck like ride.
4643	great on fuel - fun to drive - I'll never be able to get my wife out of this vehicle.
4660	My 6'3friends aren't afraid to ride in my car, they actually prefer it!
4661	The cargo space is a bit smaller than one would like, but
4666	I would not purchase another Hyundai for three reasons: (1) the dealership was unfair in negotions , (2) the tires were poor and wore out too soon w/no warranty, and (3) it is not good on gas.
4672	It has some cons but its looks great, drives even better and it will make you smile every time you drive it.
4677	FIRST TIME OWNER OF A HYUNDAI,SEE HOW IT DOES WHEN WE TAKE A TRIP IN A COUPLE MONTHS
4682	love my hundai
4688	Love driving it around the Denver Metro area during the week and up to the mountains on the weekends.

4700	I've gotten 36 MPG on the HWY in ECO driving mode, (@ 60 MPH), with the A/C on ... at 73 MPH, it drops to 33 MPG ... in town - 28 to 30.
4706	The is my second Hyundai and this SUV will make me buy a third hyundai.
4708	I am very happy with it.
4713	My wife has 2011 Tucson Limited AWD and loves it and I wanted something higher than my previous Elantra; so I bought a FWD GLS as our second vehicle.
4718	Except for the spongy breaks I can live with the rest.
4730	We were between the CRV and the Tucson and the heated seats on the GLS tipped the scales for us.
4732	This car makes our 1000 mile treks to our daughter in college pleasurable.
4738	OUR SECOND HYUNDAI.
4754	very good deal
4764	I'd highly recommend and would greatly consider getting another when the time comes to trade in the car.
4772	I have only owned it for two weeks, but I am impressed with how Hyundai stepped it up from the 2005 model I just traded in.
4788	I would totally suggest this car to anyone that wants to have a stylish yet functional and practical car, this hits all the angles for me and I will be driving this car for a long time.
4803	You will be patting yourself on the back for having
4809	I actually purchase the veloster turbo from a dealer 135 miles from where I live (local dealers just stocked automatic in black or silver).

4816	best compact car we have owned.
4835	Great gas mileage, comfortable seats, love the touchscreen.

5182	We have not encountered any real problems with it at all.

5245	This is a wonderfully fun car to drive and it's crisp lines with beautiful interior makes it spectacular.

5432	Really is the best car I've owned (includes the Ulimate BMW 530).
5433	I have a 2010 G37xS with 30K miles for over 2 years now and would buy a 2013 if this one wasn't such a great car.
5455	Best car I have ever owned ...
5470	Overall, would highly recommend this vehicle; I've driven it for over a year without a single problem.
5475	I previously owned a G35, great car.
5498	This has been an amazing car for me.

5526	Best vehicle I ever owned
5531	I've had 4 SUV's and I can honestly say this one is my favorite!
5532	I love this vehicle - other than the headrest on the front seats.
5574	I migrated to this brand after having to take out a second mortgage to pay for the constant repairs on a BMW 540i.
5598	Perfect size - not too big, not too small.
5599	Quality, feature set is just right, quiet, no road noise is coming into the cabin except 3.7 liter engine roar when pushed.

5605	I'm delighted with my new Q50 AWD Hybrid.
5606	The car drives beautifully and it's packed with features, bells and whistles.
5614	As an overall comparison, we also own a 2013 Cadillac ATS4 Premium 3.6 and a 2013 BMW 335 X-Drive Luxury Line, and the Q50 S AWD.
5620	I am very happy with the Q50 Sport Hybrid.
5642	The InTouch system controls the audio, climate, and navigation systems and has major bugs.
5650	If you have never had one you will have another and another or you may never need but one.I've seen 420,000 miles on these cars and they still look, drive, perform with style.I've had Acura, Audi, Subaru,Saab,V
5667	This will be my one and only Infiniti.
5668	I will go back to my Audi in 2-3 years when I trade again.
5673	I've driven Infinitis for the past 12 years and I have found them relatively trouble free and nicely designed, particularly the first generation g sedan and coupe of which I owned both.
5690	I've owned a great many performance cars (two GTO's, Corvette, Audi TT, Shelby Mustang, two Mustang GT's, and 4 Jags among others) and this is by far the best and most enjoyable to drive.
5705	I've had it for about 3 months.
5717	The car is somewhat difficult to get in and out.

5757	My ninth Jaguar in the past twenty years and the best of them all so far !
5772	love it
5801	Have had the car only a little more than a month.
5803	We'll see how it holds up over time.
5808	When you are driving it casually it can be soft and comfortable and quite frankly a joy to drive, but when you find yourself staring at a newly found curvy road, it can be anything but subdued.
5824	The new Jeep Cherokee is everything its predecessor was and much more!
5839	No buyers remorse.
5845	It handles well on the highway as well in heavy local traffic.
5852	Loving everything about our Trail Hawk so far and we have had the weather to prove it!
5853	Very comfortable seats and excellent driving position.
5866	One of the best Jeeps in years.A great in between vehicle, combining attributes of the Wrangler and Grand Cherokee.

5887	Overall very pleased with my purchase.
5888	Been a Ford owner most of my life, I'm happy to say I think I've crossed over to the dark side!
5894	Overall, I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase and anticipate long lines to get the Trailhawk model; she's a beast.
5899	Excellent Choice and great millage
5914	We have gotten lots of compliments
5926	In the end the other attributes of the Cherokee overcame my disappointment with cargo space, making the 2014 Jeep Cherokee a BUY!
5943	The Trailhawk will be overkill for most people.
5951	fantastic suv at a great price
5956	We love our new Cherokee.
5957	We had to wait quite awhile for it but it sure seems worth the wait.
5958	We bought the Limited with almost every option.
5964	its a very good car and I recommend to other people
5982	All I can say is a pleasant surprise to find a great smaller suv with a lot of perks for a pretty low price...with great mileage.
5999	Big improvement from the 2012 Patriot that I traded in even though the insides are idential.
6011	Not a totally bad vehicle, if I did not have all the electrical problems I would be pleased with the vehicle.
6013	Right now, far from the most satisfied customer.
6027	Had the vehicle for 3 days and the electronic dash board went blank.
6029	6 days later, the navigation system went blank.
6031	A week later the radio screen froze

6114	Love love love my new cherry red Jeep.
6119	Love this truck - it is awesome!!!
6124	I read the reviews before i bought my 2014 Grand .
6126	With it comes a few problems like anything else.
6127	Had remote installed NOT ONE PROBLEM WITH IT but to read the reviews you would think it was the last
6132	Worst vehicle I have ever owned.
6135	Problems were intermittent and unpredictable.
6141	i am very happy to have bought another JEEP...it compares to the ML and is more enjoyable than an AUDI Q5 (egg salad without mayo)
6151	I am very pleased with this vehicle which replaced my 11 year old Grand Cherokee.
6152	I liked the old one but this is a step up in terms of luxury and performance.
6157	You could spend less and get one of the other versions of the Grand Cherokee, but my decision to but the Summit was based on the ride and the appearance.
6163	I have only had this for about a month now and am still learning my way around it.
6168	Overall it is a great vehicle and I am a Jeep lover so we will get along well.

6174	An extremely well put together and engineered vehicle
6179	The Jeep Grand Cherokee is a wonderful car.
6185	Overall, I am extremely happy with my Liberty.
6186	Thanks to Jeep's cash incentives and dealership discounts, the price of this new vehicle was a bargain.
6187	The ride and handling of the liberty are fantastic for a truck-based SUV... and I can't understand why
6192	I went from a Grand Cherokee to a Liberty.
6195	It looks great and rides very well.
6207	It's a great smaller Suv for daily use w/ the convenience of offroad capabilities.
6212	This is my 2nd Jeep Liberty, and the 12th Jeep in my family.
6213	We have never had any issues with our Jeeps and have always loved that they would make it through any winter that was thrown at them.
6220	Overall its a good vehicle.
6228	It's an ok vehicle but if I had been able to forsee the problems I would not have purchased it.
6233	Good vehicle to own
6238	Good rugged American style vehicle, needs a little refinement
6243	I really like this vehicle - it is the most well rounded design available.
6244	It tows a camping trailer well, is good off road, handles and ride comfortably, is practically sized, and after a year of ownership has been perfectly reliable.
6251	I purchased a 2012 Jeep Patriot, but only owned for 3 months, just was not right for me, cheap interior, seats uncomfortable, and no power
6256	For us, we could not have a better vehicle.
6257	We looked for a long time and knew this was the right truck for us.
6258	We also have a 2008 Sebring Hardtop convertible and the two vehicles have identical controls and dash layout, hands free phone and navigation,

6293	Have had hardly any trouble with any of my jeeps.
6304	I bought it before productions discontinued !
6309	We bought the Jeep as a replacement for my thirteen-year-old college car.
6310	We've owned it now for six months and with the exception of the roof side rails and the amount of gas we go through, we are happy with our purchase.
6327	Great SUV amazingly capable and reminds me of previous cherokee.
6333	great truck tough, strong, good control, feels great while driving.
6334	I recommend it for people who like the feel of a real truck but want something that's not tremendous and takes up lots of space
6339	Good ute but not great as a rental.
6351	Mine has been very reliable.
6352	I use synthetic fluids and follow all maintance requiremnts and I did bring the noise of a driveline clunk to the dealers attention
6357	Love my vehicle and If gas mileage and engine power on takeoff were improved, it would be a major contender.

6391	GREAT smooth ride.
6414	The Perfect Family Jeep: great for retirees as the main vehicle.

6423	It took a lot of searching to find a nicely equipped Patriot with the 5 speed transmission but it was worth it
6441	My wife and I LOVE this vehicle!
6442	I just went over the 200k mile mark on my 2004 Tacoma.
6448	Great in every way.
6449	Would buy another in a heartbeat.
6450	12,000 miles, not one problem.
6455	I would purchase this vehicle again.
6461	It handled so well, I was no doubt impressed when it got me home safely in blizzard like conditions.
6462	It's perfect for me and my family, we love driving it.
6471	gives you a safe feeling when driving conditions are not so comfortable.
6482	This is my second one.
6490	Again, for the price, I could not be happier.
6496	Mine has 50000 miles on it and I've loved driving it for each one
6501	VERY happy with my purchase.
6516	I would examine all vehicles in this price range before purchasing another Jeep.
6517	Unless you have no reason to need your electronic toys powered up and one 12 volt plug is enough for you, and you don't experience the electronic issues I have....you may be
6522	I would recommend a jeep to my friends

6579	comfortable and trail worthy car
6584	Love it so far.
6585	This is my first Jeep and wonder why I didn't buy one years ago.
6591	I?m happy!!!
6597	love it love it, love it!!!!
6602	I will never buy anything other than a Wrangler from now on!
6607	It's cool, you know what you are getting into when buying a Wrangler so don't expect a smooth ride or luxury.
6608	I have the unlimited in black and it is sweet, keeping it clean is a different matter.
6610	thats why I got it.
6615	Surprises me for gas mileage and how they hold their value!!!
6625	I truly enjoy driving my Jeep, I even let my husband drive it on the weekends when I'm not working.
6626	I feel safe driving in a vehicle that is higher up.
6667	Being a loyal GM owner for the last 20+ years, it was time to move on.

6728	I had an Infinity and this one beats it at a very good price.
6729	Great car and the dealership was one of the best I have ever done business with.
6734	I will probably go back to the Lexus LS - my old 2000 LS400 was more enjoyable to own , ride in and to drive.Only 1700 miles and almost 4 months of ownership I am disappointed.
6744	Only own this for about 2 months but am very happy.
6746	Ride is smooth and solid.
6747	Not too cushy, but bumps are subtley muffled.
6748	All systems seem to be at the top of their game.
6754	If you can find one at a dealership buy it, you will not find a better car value.
6760	The sound system is one of the best and I can even put pictures of the family on the screen.
6766	If you're looking for a car that has all the options of a an expensive car but is reasonably priced, buy a Cadenza.
6771	This was a very good choice for me coming from a 1999 Mitsubishi Diamante.
6772	I like luxury without the badge, and wanted a car that I feel I can live with for many years.
6778	This was a very good choice for me coming from a 1999 Mitsubishi Diamante.

6826	And like I said earlier the car is WELL built, I will keep it way past the 10yrs.....
6842	Purchased the fully loaded EX model.
6844	The six-speed automatic transmission works seamlessly.
6850	I would recommend this to anyone looking at higher-end cars (Corolla, Elantra etc) Great car at good price with lots of luxuries.
6855	the car is not bad at all just a spare tire lether seats better radio thats it
6865	I wish I had leased the higher end upgrade with electric seats.
6866	I was kind of used to them with my Sorrento, but overall I love this car.
6872	I do not have too much to complain about...
6877	Excellent vehicle, great price, great dealership.
6878	Check out the Kia before you spend more on a different brand.
6884	I have saved hundereds off dollars in FUEL so Far since April when i purchased it.
6889	nICE SMOOTH RIDE.
6895	OVERALL ITS A NICE DRIVING VEHICLE
6900	Have The 13/Optima SX and The 14/Forte EX Love Both Cars, They are Parked Side by Side In The Garage!
6910	The Forte is the best car I've ever driven
6916	I am really impressed with Kia!
6921	love this car can't wait until I can take it out on the highway
6949	Nice little car.But Im not only disapointed, Im very unhappy with the purchase based on the transmission problem, and the customer service is completely unaceptable.
6959	GREAT CAR
6971	I just love my new vehicle
6981	I test drove everything, and I do mean everything from a Honda/Nissan/Ford up to a $40k sport utility truck and then choose a Kia.
6986	I would rate my Kia Rio an 8.5 out of 10.
6991	Love this car!
6996	Attractive and good handling
7001	i have 17k on it and no problems at all
7027	Over all a great little car.
7029	I can't say enough good about it, & would (and do) recommend it to anyone who's interested in buying a small car.
7041	I would recommend to a family member or best friend.
7053	Quite satisfied through this early mileage..the true test comes at 25,000 and then 50, 000 etc.
7054	Look, if you want to get AC, but not pay a lot for a car, this one is it....My car is as basic as anything built, but totally fulfills my needs (retired, mid-
7059	so far so good but i have had the car only a week
7064	Great car for the money, I got high end features such as backup camera, power mirror, and power folding mirrors for the same price as base models of other vehicles.
7069	I WORK FOR KMMG AND I DRIVE 80 MILES A DAY OR ABOUT 480 MILES A WEEK..I GOT THE CAR IN MARCH 2012 AND HAVE 20890 MILES AND I HAVE HAD KNOW TRUBLE OUT OF IT.

7077	easy to work with dealer
7087	Best car for the money I could find
7106	My wife and I love it.
7115	I HAD A pt CRUISER AND WAS HAPPY WITH IT EXCEPT THE MILAGE WAS BAD.
7116	this car is like a small PT cruiser with excellent milage.
7123	All in all, I dislike this car and cannot wait to trade it.
7124	Only 3,000 miles on the clock - anone interested?
7129	We will wait and see before we write an overall review.
7144	Would highly recommend the Kia Sedona!
7146	You will end up paying a lot more for a lot less.
7156	The Kia Sedona is the right fit for me and my family.
7158	The quiet but powerful V6 coupled with a smooth 6 speed transmission is superb.
7180	The very best vehicle.We have ever owned.
7182	The word for this van is Extraordinarly the best!
7187	Will never buy another chrysler van,

7268	Not a good vacation car for more than 2 people.
7285	Best city suv have had.

7303	great value and it attracts attention
7308	I own a Range Rover Sport GT Limited Edition and I absolutely love this vehicle.
7310	Though this vehicle was a lease, I will be certain to consider another Range Rover Sport after the lease expires.
7316	I feel safe behind the wheel of this truck.
7327	best off roading vehicle ever
7334	and it was about $1500 less.
7335	In our minds, it was worth it for the service and quality that Lexus brings.
7343	I have removed the rear-seat head restraints, which helps a little but not enough.
7360	Would buy it again!!
7390	ALL 100%
7400	This is my first Lexus and first hybrid vehicle and I couldn?t be more pleased.
7402	The ride is noticeably smooth, tranquil and quiet; perhaps the best in the
7407	this car is outstanding, my second hybrid car and i must say the best, does not lack any comforts and above all else does not look like a cab!!
7412	We had a 2012 ES 350, and enjoy the 2013 ES 300h more.

7498	Was about to purchase a 2013 Avalon Ltd but looked at ES 350 and agreed to buy the same day.
7504	This is not a  car- this is a fine automobile!

7676	Highly recommend this vehicle.
7677	Overall performance is great, the interior is quiet.
7681	My Dealer has been awesome.
7686	Sporty 4 door sedan that is fun to drive!

7696	8 out of 10
7701	I made a second evaluation of this vehicle.
7702	It is just Great.
7705	Lexus=Trouble free.

8070	I would have rated it all perfect if it the back seat can fit my kids, on two can sit fine, the middle does not fit any one and uncomfortable
8075	After having owned five Lexus LS models over the past 16 years, I would say without hesitation that this one is my favorite.
8087	This is my 3rd Lexus but my first LS.
8088	It was my retirement gift to myself and I fell so fortunate, safe, empowered and comfortable behind the wheel of my LS.

8267	Have never had any major or minor problems!
8277	Owned the car for 6 months.
8278	A great commuter car, but not for the family.

8503	highly recommend.
8528	Love the Sync, much improved over earlier versions.
8529	Read professional reviewers comments, they must not have spent much time with the vehicle as those reviews did not reflect my experiences at all.
8530	Was very impressed by Lincoln, more people need to test
8535	This crossover is a gem, and doesn't get the respect from the auto reviewers that it deserves.
8536	You would be hard-pressed to find a better luxury crossover anywhere right now, and we have tried them all.
8550	Heavy vehicle, which enhances solid feel.
8551	Feels like a rocket with the Eco boost.
8556	Great lovely car, with so much available amenities, and wonderful family hauler.
8561	Excellent car all through out.
8573	While I can get bored easily, the MKS is a keeper for the reasons that I mentioned above.
8584	I previously owned a 2010 MKS Eco boost and I absolutely loved that car.
8585	I upgraded to the 2013 MKS Eco boost and it is a totally different car.

8687	Very happy that I purchased .Fun to drive home, from a hard days work!
8703	It is responsive, quiet and comfortable.Who would have ever thought a V-6 could generate so much power from a   little 3.5 liter engine.
8708	The car is quiet ,rides well and put together well with a lot of features for the price.
8709	Before you criticize the car for foreign models take it for a test drive.
8723	I find this car to be fun to drive.

8782	what an amazing vehicle..
8797	Great car from a great company they care about consumers
8802	Good purchase
8814	Hazardous navigation system.
8815	Very disappointed.
8820	The MKX is the way to go.
8824	The Lincoln my touch works just fine.
8836	In order to take advantage of everything the car can do, be prepared to read and refer to the owners manual for a while.
8838	As I drive it, I occasionally need to look
8843	Would be an almost perfect vehicle except for the frustrating My Lincoln Touch issues.
8848	Excellent Vehicle, I have no complaints
8859	Rides great, good power and decent gas mileage.
8865	I made a very poor choice when I bought this car.

8875	I went back to the dealer I bought the car from and was told there was nothing they could do.I notified the company but the company totally ignored my complaint.
8876	I am not sure I will buy another Lincoln again.

8982	This car is drawing attentiona great indicator for future of the brand!
8983	I have had all ages complement style of the new MKZ from the High School kids to heir Grand Parents.
8988	She loves it but she traded in a 2011 Lincoln MKZ that she loved.
8996	Suspension and Steering was capa
9001	An amazing vehicle for a reasonable cost.

9042	Overall: The best car I have ever owned.
9044	Roomier, faster, and with better gas mileage than any other luxury hybrid on the market.
9051	The hybrid Lincoln MKZ is fun to drive, has good pick up speed and my current gas mileage is 34.1 mpg.
9052	It has nearly 5,000 miles on it since we purchased it new in August 2012.
9058	Would recommend to anyone wanting comfort, style, and safety as well as the desire to save money with greatfuel economy!I LOVE this car!
9063	An outstanding vehicle, and environmentally friendly.
9069	I'd buy this car again without hesitation.
9075	I paid zero premium between the Hybrid version and the gas version of the MKZ.
9088	It is more stylish that the Town Car, has an excellent turning radius, very responsive and offers a quiet and fun driving experience.
9089	I Love it.
9099	One of the best cars I have ever owned (14 so far)
9104	Best car we've ever owned.
9105	When we replace our other car, it will be with another Lincoln Hybrid.
9106	Great warrenty too!
9111	I've had the car now 4 months and pretty much like everything about it other than the trunk size.
9113	I'm still increasing my mpg's but it's doing better than adve
9118	Would do it again.
9124	I'm quite happy we chose the American made luxury hybrid.
9125	The price diffrence probably won't be recovered in gas mileage over the gas model but we feel better about doing our small part in reducing emissions and being more efficient.
9140	Outstanding drive, technology, design and overall performance.
9142	Price of upkeep and maintainance is very reasonable in luxury line, as well.
9148	I found this one, and finally decided to get one.
9149	It is doing what I want it to do...*s*
9159	a excellent choice
9164	I wanted it for longer road trips.
9165	the 40 plus mpg and smooth ride have made mytwo 4000 miles to the east worth the purchase.
9184	Over all not bad car hard to see to side and rear but getting used to using the mirrows and backup camera warning sinsor are a nusance.
9200	Best large SUV !
9205	Very luxurious, large, and also dependable on the road.
9210	this the best car in the world.
9215	My experience owning these vehicles has been very rewarding.
9216	I would say the styling, V-8 power, comfort, safety features, along with reliability of the TC (probably driven 500,000) miles----has been beyound my expectations.
9222	I would gladly recommend this vehicle to other drivers.
9228	I love my Lincoln Town Car and this is number four.
9229	At 6'6', I have much room.
9230	But I have made some changes.
9231	I took the regular air filter out and put in a K&N permanent air filter.

9418	The best car ever, it's often mistaken for a limo.
9430	After driving with me to Maine, she fell in love with it.
9441	Spend the extra and get the Grand Touring-it is well worth it!
9443	It handles almost as well as my Miata did.
9454	great car for the money, a really good value
9460	Not only that, it's a Top Safety Pick, and is loaded with ALL KINDS of options.
9491	For something you can drive off the lot under 20K, yo
9496	If looking for a great crossover SUV, this one is it in my book.
9497	I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CAR!!!!
9498	If you don't mind the slower acceleration and want the better mileage stick with the 2013.
9512	We wanted a vehicle with lots of room and good gas economy.
9513	This was a wonderful choice.
9518	Never have been a big fan of SUV's but this one turned me.
9519	A great little SUV for the couple on the go or the small family.
9529	We just bought this SUV a couple of weeks ago and so far it's been absolutely wonderful.
9536	not so pleased with this vehicle.
9537	...I should have kept my Prius.
9547	my fiance' fights with me over who's car this is, I love the pushbutton start, and keyless entry, we got the sport AWD version, and so far are satified with it's performance on-road, and in severe winter conditions.
9548	we purchased in sept of 2012. Review I
9560	If you only have kids back there you should be okay though.
9566	I am very pleased over all a   pretty vehicle, very sporty looking

9586	The supension, brakes and steering are fantastic.
9600	great car, test drive it and you will be sold
9605	I own another Mazda that I have had for over twenty years without any major repairs.
9607	I actually purchased the vehicle in March of 2012, but that choice wasn't available for this review.
9612	Good overall.
9637	That has yet to be seen, but if it's that bad, I stay home, or take out the ole 1999 F-250 7.3.
9644	My daughter likes mine so much, she bought one for herself.
9657	I find the driver seat uncomfortable- for a short person like me.
9658	My husband says my 2008 Mazda 3 driver seat is uncomfortable.

9695	Overall, a good vehicle.
9703	Happy with vehicle overall.
9709	It's the most impressed I've been with a new car in 12 years of buying them.
9715	The GT trim is well worth it and comfortable if you enjoy a sporty drive (stiff springs).
9726	I ordered it a couple of days after test driving, It's definitely the vehicle I want to be in for the next few years and the most fun SUV I've ever driven.
9736	I would buy another one if I had to or recommend it to another potential buyer
9741	Shortly after we purchased our CX-5, I shared our positive experience with a colleague who was looking at comparable vehicles.
9750	Suspension is the weakest part of an overall excellent automobile.

9757	Recommend the tech package highly.
9764	Would Recommend and Purchase this car Again.
9774	Excellent all weather vehicle, fun to drive, economical on gas
9785	I am obsessed with it!!!!

9809	And yes, I bought the license plate frame!
9814	great car,better than the honda crv , I had

9935	Would not say I am unhappy with the car or regret buying it.
9941	Love the proximity sensor.
9942	Its Nice to approach the CX-9, press door button enter and start, without removing keys from pocket.
9943	Also enjoy feature, to key press 2x and hold, and have the front windows and sunroof open to get rid of that hot blast of air.
9948	I would buy another one if the 4 items I mentioned are addressed (changed/added).
9955	Gas milage is good for its size, I rate it a 10 all around.
9960	This is my second CX9.
9963	Very pleased have had it about a month.
9974	We are extremely happy with our purchase.
9985	Every time I see one of its competitors on the road, I shake my head and wonder why the driver didn't buy a Mazda.
9990	Overall I would rate my Mazda CX9 a ten

10011	They won't give me a ride home if I leave the car with them because I live more than 10 miles from their dealership.
10018	Mazda attitude about fixing this car is the worst.
10021	They tell me I have t
10026	Love the Sprited green, really turns heads.
10027	My wife drives this car more than her Infiniti EX35.
10033	I would highly recommend this car to anyone looking for an inexpensive commuter that can double for traveling reasonable distances on vacation and carry plenty of stuff for shopping ... good stereo, good lights, cruise control, alloys ... just needs more

10106	Great handling car , back seat & wind noise were my main problem,salesman were awesome & not pushy
10111	2014 Mazda3 is best summed up as a game changer.
10134	Over all for the size and what we use it for it fills the bill and more.
10139	Overall, I enjoy driving it eventhough it's not that great driving on long trips.
10140	You need to go to rest stops every 2.5 hours just to stretch your legs.
10147	GREAT ALL AROUND CAR.
10152	I traded in a recent Forester Subaru, again, very sensible, and plain, yet, the M5 is extremely fun and a great value for the dollar.
10158	Mazda 5 has so many user-friendly features, overlooked by many, but build in as part of the overall concept of versatility and exceptional value.
10171	Anyone who is in the market for a new sedan with a quality feel, great looks, class leading fuel economy and sporty handling should drive this car.
10183	In my one week of ownership over all I am pleased with the car intended functions....Its fun to drive and it makes my driveway look sexier than ever before...I thoroughly checked out all the competition (Nissan, Honda, Toyota) and this car was the only c

10247	Would I buy another?
10253	I've owned this car for six months now, and already have 10,000 miles on it.
10267	I purchased the vehicle through TRUE CAR, best choice I could have made I saved over $2500 of MSRP.

10287	Love all the features.
10297	This is a great car, it's fun to drive.

10316	Should cost over $10,000 more, but do not tell Mazda.
10322	So good I cannot believe I do not see more on the rode.
10327	This is the best car I've ever had, and I've had two BMWs.
10328	i've had it for a month and driven it 1150 miles, on both highways and NYC streets.
10330	I have the GT in Soul Red, so it looks great and is fully loaded.
10341	Compared to Camry, Accord, Altima (all of which I have driven) this is a driver's car that is tight and fun to drive unlike the others.
10348	We still love this car.
10349	A lot of people come up to us and ask question on the car.
10350	I also love the gas mileages that I get.
10370	This is an exceptional car.
10373	Just with a few tweaks and it is a no brainer.
10378	The 2014 Mazda 6 is the working man's Exotic Sports Sedan!

10407	Excellent car.
10413	I am 100% satisfied.
10423	Love the car!
10434	I chose the Mazda 6 over the Nissan Altima and Subaru Legacy because it had and style and the features I liked best.
10452	The only fault I can find in the 2014 Mazda 6 is that it is taking me a little time to adjust to the difference in power after owning a 2011 Grand Touring with the V6.
10458	I compared with Camry, Accord, and Altima, and decided to go with 6.
10459	I'm happy I made that decision.

10482	I love it!!
10487	Great car!

10639	Owning an RX8 is like being married to a beautiful but wayward womanYou keep saying you'll take it back one more timeAnd just when you get ready to trust it againBang!
10651	I have owned the car for 1 year and live in New England.
10652	Handled well even in the snow with snow tires.
10668	The automatic is pathetic, so I bought a 2004 six speed.
10669	I've put 40K miles on my RX8, & the only problem has been the replacement of a catalytic converter... which Mazda covered/paid for.
10675	Problem free for over a year.

10847	My 450 has all the new and modern safety features that i was looking for.
10852	Quite rewarding experience.
10858	This is my third ML & by far it is best one.
10859	So very much improved over my 2000 ML320 and I loved my 2004 ML350 with its improvements, but my, oh, my, my 2012 is like driving a cloud!

11069	Fast,responsive and great looking car
11074	We looked at a BMW 3 series and a Lexus IS 250C before buying this car We are very happy with the SLK.

11114	My first really small car, I love my mini, and wouldn't trade it in for anything.
11116	The included maintenance is awesome too.
11137	Wasn't planning to buy at that moment, but had to jump on that find.
11138	Not a moments regret on that decision, really.
11139	The car is reliable (not a bit of trouble in the 2 years I've owned it)
11144	Ok, I am under 5 feet and I do not feel as if I am setting in the bottom of a well when driving the  MINI .
11145	We rented a car to pickup the  MINI , so we did not have to drive two cars home.
11152	Would buy it again.
11157	It's a keeper

11411	As much as we liked out 2011 Outlander, it was an easy choice to go with the new 2014.
11418	Great SUV for the price.
11426	The outlander is a lot of fun.
11427	I look forward to driving every morning.
11433	I would put this SUV up against any 4 cyl RAV4, CRV or Escape!!
11441	In snow, it gives me great confidence.
11447	I love my Outlander, My son bought a Outlander Sport at the same time, he loves the Sport.
11456	Got the Outlander - had t
11461	Discounted it can't be beat for pricing and features.Best deal going if you test drive it and ignore the media stigma on Mitsubishi.
11466	The design took a while to grow on me, but after checking out this car at the dealer, I fell in love right away.

11508	Although affordable to only a few, it is the most thrilling and capable thing on 4 wheels.
11513	Wonderful car-will buy another one.
11531	I know dealers put so much options on the Boxster that you end up paying 10 k more.
11534	It was great and I felt free driving with the top down.
11539	The Boxster S has incredible acceleration, cornering and breaking capabilites.
11540	It is very comfortable and smooth on the open road.
11554	I would buy it again, in a heart beat.
11555	Just wish it had GPS and rear camara.
11575	Will go back for our next vehicle for sure.
11580	I have been pulling a cattle trailer around with this truck for a few months now and love it.
11582	THe truck has more than enough power and gets better gas mileage than either of my chevys.
11588	All accessories have operated flawlessly; The available storage in the cabin and the Ram box are excellent no need to install an aftermarket storage box.
11596	Much better for in-town and light duty driving and hauling, and in a totally dif
11601	Owned a 2009 Ram 1500, the 2013 model has a revised interior which is much approved.
11609	I have friends who own new Fords and Chevys they are very nice trucks but they agree dollars worth winner is the Ram.
11614	Best Buy
11631	I assum the testers drove the vehicle for one day and made a decision.
11645	I would never buy a used one.
11651	Why did I wait soooo long to dump the SUV and get a pick-em-up truck!?
11662	Bought Larime Longhorn and paid 45000 and feel like I got a steal.
11679	Best vehicle I have ever owned.
11684	I bought this vehicle due to the dealership discounts (11,000).
11685	First time truck owner, have owned many different cars in my life; but this RAM 150 is by far the cream of all my former vehicle.
11692	I traded my 2009 F-150 in on it and am happy.
11697	Looking forward to breaking it in.
11702	The design is beautiful Longhorn Laramie is definitely worth what I paid for it.

11737	I purchased the truck in Feb. 2013 after my last Dodge was totaled.
11738	I drive a lot and carry a lot of tools and decided to go with the V6/8SPD combo to get the best mileage.
11739	I feel this truck has better pep than my old Dakota V8, and gets fantastic mileag
11744	First time Ram 1500 owner - Svc Mgr for GM dealer and Ram switched me
11749	I own a corvette, a Mid size SUV and this 4x4 Dodge Ex cap truck.

11991	This cars sugar is RAW.
11994	Buy one and find your one road.BORN FROM JETS!!!

12014	I love the Saab and I will buy like 3 more in the future.
12024	Overall I have been happy with my car, I do not see many on the road and for the value compared to other European SUV's it has it all for a better price
12029	It is a great car and I like it a lot.
12034	Even though Saab has filed for bankruptcy I really am not all that concerned.
12035	At least I have a great car that I will enjoy every day and won't see one coming the other way all that often.
12041	Great car so far.
12046	I would buy this car again and again.

12053	Had to get the brake rotors fixed upon delivery but otherwise has been an absolute pleasure to own & drive.
12062	Was no problem in this car.
12064	Feel proud everyday to drive it, silly as that sounds.
12070	WOW.....BEST CAR I HAVE EVER OWNED !!!!
12076	I purchased a new 2010 Saab 9-5 in February 2011.
12077	Within 4 months of driving it out of the showroom in Winston-Salem, NC, the suspension warning light came on to have it checked.
12078	Then everything went out on the Enfotainment system - no radio, no navigati
12089	No way was it worth the original sticker price of $44k!
12095	Love this car!!
12108	Very good car for the dollars spent and I have no second thoughts or qualms about my purchase decision.
12115	Not a family vehicle, but a fun ride each and every time.
12121	Good acceleration, but it is mostly a beautiful car that can be pushed to its and your driving limits!
12127	The car is peppy, responsive, is fun to drive and looks great.
12128	I've gotten many compliments.
12140	I purchased a base Nissan 370Z for 29k, test drove similarly equipped FR-S and priced for 28k.One must be not understand can get a REAL sports car for right under 30k (Nissan 370Z) to buy the FR-S

12199	I overall think its a fun car to drive
12205	I actually look forward to driving it and sometimes I make excuses just to get out and take it for a spin.
12210	After over 30 years of driving front wheel drive automatics I returned to my sports car roots (MG Midget, Mini, Sunbeam Alpine & Tiger, Fiat 124 Spyder) and do not regret my decision.
12216	WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A LEAST 225 HORSES AND MORE TORQUE BUT THE CAR IS AN EYE STOPPER AS IT IS.

12340	Great car to save you money even if you have a lead foot.
12348	Great second car to run errands in.
12353	i love this car and it is the best gas saver vehicle that i've owned.

12365	Great car, decent acceleration, good reliability.
12375	I just love this little car!
12376	So much fun to drive and since all my outings end up in parking lots, this little guy just makes parking lots of any shape or size a snap to park in.
12377	I leave the back seats down and folded a big blanket to fit back there, now
12382	A whole lot of car for the price.. sporty enough to go when you need to, enough horse power for hills (so far).
12395	Great car would buy another today.
12400	Love it!
12415	Overall, for what this car is I give it a  Ten   .
12425	ITS AWSOME, I BOUGHT IT RIGHT AWAY

12536	Great car.
12546	This is my first non manual car since the 80's so I know about the gear change hesitation,doesn't bother me.
12547	Perfect second car.
12548	The only time I drive my other car is to Church on Sunday, or when the weather is severe, heavy flooding rain and windy,It's
12553	wouldn't buy it again.
12558	I started driving this car using the Car2Go service in DC.
12559	I was amazed at how much space was inside for how small it looked on the outside ( I'm a big guy 6' 290 and I fit in it just fine).
12560	I really became attached to how easy it was to drive this car i
12566	I bought the car new in 2009 and I have only approximately 15,000 miles on it because it doesn't go on long trips.
12567	Insurance rates are low.
12597	Fun car to drive!
12603	Mine is a 2009 and I bought it used.
12604	All of the items on the negative list are issues, but I like the car and accept it for what it is: a small 2 seat car.
12605	It does not try and be somet

12617	I like it more now than when I bought it.

12767	We purchased this vehicle at the high point dollar wise, but it is an investment that will hopefully lead to lower pric
12774	It must be experienced to understand completely how it changes the paradigms.
12780	This car is a game changer- you must get in one to appreciate how much better a car it is than all of the other cars on the road today.
12802	Watch out, big oil!
12807	The car gets better over time as more features are added via software release.
12817	This car has to be driven to realize how game changing it truly is.
12844	Until you drive one of these, you have no idea what an electric car designed from the ground up can be.
12846	The low center of gravity and instantaneous maximum torque make this car behave like a car that i

12887	Excellent car for an electric one.
12905	What a pleasure to drive past gas stations and help the environment too.

12907	My other car is a 2006 Prius which, in comparison, is real basic transportation.
12927	Best car I ever had!
12933	I'd like to be able to plug it into an electricity source that doesn't use fossil fuel.
12973	But I found a Satin Pearl White one and have never looked back.
12974	Its my second vehicle so I can't comment on handling in snow or poor weather cond
12989	I love the BRZ, but not as a daily drive car.
13003	If you like the feeling of being on rails when you're negotiating a corner, you have to drive this car.

13085	I am not trying to knock the BRZ, not by any stretch.
13093	i would by this car again in a heartbeat,fantasic car
13103	Fun, fun , fun...Yeah an extra 30 HP would be nice but not a deal breaker.
13104	Radio could be better too....Ive got the limited and i think its well worth the 28 Grand i paid.
13105	Got the car for MSRP....
13111	Overall, Recommended for a sporty, fun car to afford one many smiles that is affordable.
13112	Not a speed demon, but find the curves and corners and you can imagine yourself in a very high end car driving experience very easlily.
13117	An incredible value!
13156	Absolutely Outstanding - a home run for Subaru!
13167	This car is a winner.
13168	I got out of my 2012 Forester lease early to buy this vehicle and it's my 3rd Forester.
13175	This is a terrific vehicle.
13176	I traded up from a 2010 and don't regret it.
13183	Our first Subaru.
13184	Test drove all the competition and the Subaru blew them all away.
13185	Great vehicle.
13196	The electronic power steering took a couple days to get used to but now I love it.
13203	I now have to hope my wife wants to drive a stick shift model
13210	I had to wait 8 weeks since 2014 model is sold out.
13220	Great ride
13227	The Mazda was fun to drive but the Subaru felt lumbering
13238	The basic interiors such as small glove box and door pockets could be improved.
13240	We almost bought an Outback and are sorry we didn't sinceit's more roomy and a better value for th
13245	Love the Subarus and this is my 3rd one.
13252	The outstanding bad spot is a big side pillar making left shoulder checks cumbersome and therefore dangerous.
13258	Bot 2.5i premium, I was surprised at the acceleration with cvt, rear camera is good but screen could have been a little bigger.Ride is very good and controlled.
13266	Overally I would choose this vehicle again.
13268	The forester provides the best bang for your buck.
13274	great car
13291	Lacking in cushioning, thigh support and side bolsters to hold you in place, while turning etc???
13303	Love, love, love this vehicle!
13304	It is wonderful!
13309	Great vehicle , wish the extra's ( hitch , cargo cover, etc.
13311	Only time will tell if I become a Subaru Groupei.
13318	We had 3 subarus.
13319	Had lots of issue with 2003 forester.
13334	There is nothing to compare Subaru to.....
13340	Overall the forester is a great vehicle.
13341	i researched like crazy before buying it,and am very happy!
13346	overall this is best car ever owned!!
13360	I settled on the Subaru because I felt it provided the most features for the price & was the top choice of Consumer reports for quality & safety.. Review ID:
13376	Owned many cars and suv's This could be the most fun suv I've driven
13387	This lived up to our expectations.
13409	Highly recommend the car.
13414	Must have to go up to the snow.
13420	Here in the midwest the AWD comes in real handy, snow, rain, freezing rain, you never know what you'll get, I ski, bike and kayak, the roof racks and storage are great
13426	I use it as a city car in NYC and it fits that role perfectly.
13427	It handles great, takes potholes like a champ.
13428	The visibility while driving is perfect and I feel like I can see everything that is going on aroun
13433	a great car if you want a car that feels big and still gives you mpg and awd at a great price
13439	Safe, zippy, small, tough, reliable.
13444	Overall, this is a wonderful car for me as I drive it back and forth to work daily.
13445	I save on fuel costs with the fuel efficiency it offers and I don't have to worry about the weather conditions with the All-Wheel Drive.
13478	Its great all around because with the AWD you dont feel the lag from FWD cars when you accelerate.
13484	if it's not for the oil consumption, I love this car.
13489	Most fuel efficient and economical  ALL WHEEL DRIVEvehicle out there for a best buy !
13496	Does great in the snow.
13497	Very pleased with this car.
13502	Great little 5 door hatchback.
13506	Handling also improved and snow traction
13511	The awd and safety features gives a very secure feeling when driving.
13512	Excellent gas milage considering it has all wheel drive.
13521	At first i was not impressed with the car, even though the interior was a good improvement over the previous generation Subarus.
13532	I own a 2011 STI Hatch.
13533	With plenty of HP, AWD, Brembo brakes, and tuned sport suspension, it's a real performer.
13543	Seriously consider this car for the 25-30k range...great feel, easy to drive, great performance when you need it in awd.
13549	Its rally heritage can be felt and it gives the driver a raw and exciting feeling of a true drivers car.
13550	To get this feel usually requires paying much more
13562	I think I will injoy this car for years to come.
13567	LOVE this car, can't ever imaging owning anything but a Subaru
13583	I would recommend the legacy to everyone out there looking for a dependable and affordable vehicle!
13594	Overall, I'm very happy with the Legacy.
13595	Time will tell how trouble free it is, but Subaru does have a good reputation.
13614	Will buy the same brand.
13630	Love this car I don't why I never looked seriously at a Subaru before.
13635	This vehicle is the best value I have owned and that includes Hondas, Cadillacs, Audis, Acuras and Infinitis.
13641	If you are not in a hurry, and want a solid wagon with AWD, a decent cargo area, and nice build quality...
13650	It is a great car, can haul a ton, and easily fits 4 adults.
13651	The mid cycle changes are great.
13665	After months of test-driving and researching - we bought the Outback and could not be happier.
13666	The Outback rides nice, handles like a car in traffic, but has ground clearance and interior space of a crossover or SUV.
13673	Overall, this is the best Outback I've owned.
13675	It rides well on long trips and can carry a lot of stuff.
13681	I can not wait for the first snowfall.
13683	THIS IS THE PERFECT CAR!!
13688	Good vehicle but needs some tuning to be perfect.
13693	Probably one of the best Vehicles we have ever owned.
13694	Consumer Reports states Subaru is 2nd best... and We can deifnitely see it in our Subaru's!
13705	Love this car so far.
13715	Excellent vehicle and value for the money.
13716	Couldn't be more pleased.
13717	I've owned two Subarus and love the cars and the brand.
13732	I am totally satisfied with this outback, I purchased it in dover Delaware , from a winner dealer !!!
13742	This is a very solid car and is a great buy for the money.
13749	I live at the beach, but have not made the opportunity to check out the 4 wheel drive feature on the sand.
13754	Waste of time, regretted within hours, should have stayed with Chevy or tried Ford.
13764	Car runs great.
13765	I'd buy it again.
13770	I had considered a Toyota & Honda models with this vehicle and the valve of not paying extra for all wheel drive, and the excellent reviews by the Automotive editorials sold me.
13780	This is my first Subaru ever, after 20 years of Toyotas, so the bar is set pretty high.
13781	I can live with the dislikes I mentioned above as all cars have their quirks and I am more interested in long term reliability.
13782	I bought the Outback because of the AW
13787	We love this car overall.
13790	The biggest complaint is that it is impossible to fit
13795	I have owned this car since mid-December 2012 and have put ~2000 miles on it, driving in rain, snow, mud, streams, cold weather, and a few days of temperate weather.
13796	The car has delivered on all expectations.
13803	Great car.
13805	If you're really concerned about the lack of unneeded horsepower, I would wait for '14 - perhaps Subaru will add a V6 or 4-cyl turbo option.
13810	Fell safe in it, great looking crossover !!!
13822	Wish it drove a bit quieter and was a bit quicker merging into highway traffic, but the tradeoff is great MPG and if those are the biggest complaints, I think it's a keeper!
13827	Handles extremly well in all weather conditions (including snow), easy to drive and park both in urban/forest environment.
13828	The luggage room is enough for most of the family trips.
13835	Great roomy interior with very good seating.
13841	We love this vehicle so far,our first AWD,and it has avery short turning radius and the ride is food for a small SUV
13846	Regardless of the few   flaws  , I absolutely love it!
13847	I have no regrets, I actually can't wait for this winter to drive it and know I'll be safe and able to get down our unplowed roads with ease.
13853	I also drive a Jeep and a Ridgeline and they serve a different purpose and are fun vehicles also, but this is my little gas sipper a
13858	Wound up buying a Limited due to very  limitedavailability after Hurricane Sandy, don't really feel leather, climate control or upgraded radio is necessary, for my taste anyway.
13859	Also had idle issues with the car and got a new engine control module inst
13865	Options that are easy to use and placed on the dash just right and where you expect them to be.
13882	Very disappointing car for the price paid.
13893	Very pleased with my first Subaru.
13901	I am very pleased with this car so far.
13902	I consistently get around 30 mpg, and have gotten 34.
13903	I put some bikes on the back and that acted like a parachute so i only got 25 mpg that time.
13914	love it!!!!!
13919	We've only had the Crosstrek for a few weeks and it is Awesome.
13920	It is fun to drive, has enough power to do what's needed.
13921	Before we purchased we looked at many compact Crossovers and to get AWD with the features of the Crosstrek would cost $1000's more.
13926	I've owned this car for about three months, and put around 2,500 miles on it.
13928	I bought it just as winter ended, so I haven't gotten to test it out in the snow yet.
13929	In heavy rain it handled excellent.
13935	This is my second subie so far my wife and I like this vehicle no major complaints , we love Subaru very dependable rides.Best manufacture of vehicles , number one in consumer report,IIHS top safety pick.
13950	does evertthing i want
13955	This is the vehicle I wanted from the start of my vehicle search, but would have been a little happier if I could have paid a little less.
13962	nice crossover recomend to everone
13967	The Dealership here in Louisville is fantastic.
13969	Dont promise what they don't deliver and very organized.
13982	the rides a little bumpier so if you have a bad back it might not be the best thing for you.
13983	The car isn't particularly fast at least with a launch, but it feels fast.
13984	I can definitely go adventuring
13995	I'm gonna get a lotta drivn time outa this XV Crosstrek, that's fo sho...I have to drive yr-round from LA to PTLD and havn this dependable, sure footed & all-weather vehicle to do it all in is a God-send !
13996	Wouldn't have it any other way...thanx Subaru, u
14006	Great truck for the part-time person who hauls things around , very stylish looks great on the rode
14026	Definitely the best value out there for the money....Believe me i took my time on this purchase.Not happy that other brands want to give you a 36 months warranty and,then sell you a $2,600.00 extended warranty.
14031	I would buy it again!
14042	Good value for money, no major problems, good off-road handling.
14052	Reliable, excellent mileage for a truck and would buy again.
14057	This is my 2nd unit.
14058	First one was a 97 which I still drive.
14059	The second one is a 2008 which i bought used 3 years ago.
14069	Would NOT buy this kind of car again!
14075	My wife and I love this car and I expect to see them more and more on the road.
14080	This car is simply AMAZING!
14081	This car truly feels like a high-end German car, in that everything works together and makes you feel connected to the car.
14082	Its steering is tight and communicative, its handling is razor-sharp, and its overall feel is positive
14094	The same people probably don't know how to manipulate the CVT either!You folks just know how to  floor it ... right?
14105	You can't buy this car anymore, but if you can find a good used one it's a unbelievable value.
14106	I'm a huge fan off the size, style, sportiness, and comfort.
14111	Shame on Suzuki for not knowing how to market a great car.
14116	Great car not only for the money.
14128	Great car get one before they are all gone
14133	It's quick, and nimble.
14134	I was taking 35 mile per hour curves, at about 60, and never had a second thought.
14136	it has a feel of a much more expensive auto, from the soft interior touch spots to the way it handles and drives.
14148	I do a lot of driving for my job, so I rotate between multiple vehicles to spread the usage.
14156	I bought mine from a dealership with a Chrysler connection..
14157	The dealership promised that parts should be available.
14162	Race to a Suzuki dealer to get one before they're gone, for good.
14169	I will take extremely good car of this, A one of a kind automobile.
14185	BESIDES I'LL BE SPENDING A FORTUNE ON TIRES IF SOMETHING ISN'T CORRECTED ITS A GREAT LITTLE CAR.
14190	I would recommend the Kizashi to anyone looking for a quality mid size sedan at a reasonable cost.
14195	Solid car well built I just went swimming for 40 minutes forgot the key fob in my pocket and it still worked even though they said dont get wet.It was under water the whole time
14200	I have owned car for 1 year and it has been a very capable performer
14210	Suzuki's best kept secret that needs to be revealed to all ;)
14233	I bought this new in 2007, but this website is making me choose between 2011 & 2012.
14238	Sold it in less than a year for AWD used Matrix, a better all around value
14245	I have the 6 speed model which gives descent pickup for a four wheel drive vehicle.
14255	I love it
14260	This was the best car I have ever own - sadly, some punk decided to pull out in front of me and creamed my car which, by the way, I walked away from so the safety measures are as-like a Volvo
14267	I've owned 6 Suzuki model
14272	awesome small car.
14273	Had a vibe and loved it.
14281	I own 2 SX4 Crossovers and both perform well.
14287	Also, you'll sacrifice some trunk room-but the seats DO fold down for extra space.
14292	If you want to get more than you paid for, this is the car.
14294	I'd buy again if I didn't step up to the Kizashi.
14299	Pretty darn good car for the price so far.
14305	This is a small car and when buying a car like this don't expect a big car space or total comfort.

14365	Very good vehicle and fun to drive!
14371	There is no better deal for a quality AWD anywhere.
14384	I bought this new in 2007, but this website is making me choose between 2011 & 2012.
14396	I have the 6 speed model which gives descent pickup for a four wheel drive vehicle.
14411	This was the best car I have ever own - sadly, some punk decided to pull out in front of me and creamed my car which, by the way, I walked away from so the safety measures are as-like a Volvo
14418	I've owned 6 Suzuki model
14424	Had a vibe and loved it.
14432	I own 2 SX4 Crossovers and both perform well.
14437	Don't look for tons of room-it is essentially a small car with AWD.

14445	I'd buy again if I didn't step up to the Kizashi.

14479	Has plenty of power at all speeds and manuevers like a rally car.
14516	Very good vehicle and fun to drive!
14522	Overall this is a really solid feeling truck with ample room to take the whole family camping or to the lake, well still providing relatively good gas mileage for a larger SUV.
14523	I refer to it as a truck because behind the wheel this is really what it feel
14528	Great vehicle!
14529	I traded in a chevy 3/4 ton diesel for this 4Runner after we sold our Fifth wheel.
14530	The Toyota is easy to drive, park and fits in the garage.

14572	In addition very cheap to maintain runs off unleaded gasoline.
14577	Excellent vehicle for off road use or on road touring.
14578	Lots of people notice, and get questions, wow, what is that?
14583	We have a 1992 Camry XLE with 150,000 miles, never misses a beat.
14591	keep in mind that i use my 4runner for boat hauling, fly fishing adventures, snowy ski trips, AND downtown business meetings.
14597	So far best SUV I have owned!
14608	Slow acceleration at low speeds, picks up at higher speeds.
14609	Turns have to be negotiated slowly, unless you like that falling-of-the-seat sensation.
14616	The Explorer and Jeep were incredible vehicles, but I wanted a true truck to handle anything I can throw at it.
14621	Great SUV, still body on frame, so it will do what others would LIKE to be able to do, and still do it in style.
14627	Would highly recommend to others.
14647	This car is a bargain.
14649	Fantastic ride with a comfortable interior.
14658	You will buy an Avalon, a Lexus without the Lexus price tag.
14681	Good car, love it!
14686	I don't know where you'd find a better car in the low $30k price range.
14699	my next car will definitely be from a different company
14705	If I had to make a new car decision again, I would still opt for the Avalon.
14710	If you get the Limited model, make sure you take your Smart Phone in the car and play something via bluetooth on the stereo OR bring in a CD that you know has a song with LOW Bass sounds and test your stereo with some Volume.
14711	If the front speakers rattle
14721	Toyota knocked it out of the park with this Avalon.
14722	I would definitely buy another.
14723	This is a super smooth, comfortable, fast, luxury sedan without the luxury price tag.
14729	This is my third Toyota and they have not disappointed me yet!
14734	Best Automobile we have purchased in 30 years.
14758	We researched and shopped for 3 months before purchasing.
14759	In our opinion this was by far the best value in it's class without breaking t
14764	If they would fix the road noise issue and make the radio and speaker system as good as the gm and chrysler products they would have a winner.
14770	A great car that feels and looks good.

14804	It feels like a strong, smooth, and high quality car.
14811	A great car, I love it and enjoy the driving experience.
14813	As of yet I have not seen another on the road.
14825	It corners excellently and practically drives its self.
14853	We traded in our 2007 Avalon Limited for this updated model and simply love it.The V6 had way more get up and go than the Hybrid (duh), and we liked that, so we'll just pay gas for that 'feature'.Styling is a bit blah compared to other cars, but we're ok
14858	We love the car and actually purchased it over a Lexus ES 350 and Mercedes E-350, which left our pocket book $20K + richer.The technology built into the car is overwhelming.
14859	The car comes with several well documented manuals for the owner.
14860	Two months lat
14865	This is my second Avalon.
14866	My experience with the 2013 would cause me to get another one.
14871	i had a 2008 love it !!!!
14880	LOVE THE HANDLE!!
14882	This car gets lots of attention and honk
14902	Love this car for value, handling, and overall performance.
14926	9.9 Having owned and or driven every luxury car made in US over the last 40 years along wityh top of the line Mercedes, BMW,and Jag.I consider this to be the finest auto made.
14937	For the past 17 years I have owned a BMW convertible and a Mercedes Benz.
14944	A fantastic car to own and drive.
14949	No charging station ne
14954	I honestly don't know why the Toyota Avalon Hybrid is not on more Top Ten lists for fuel efficient vehicles.
14956	Previously, I've owned a BMW
14971	Best vehicle I ever owned.
14978	I purchased one for my wife on a recent weekenc and liked it so much I went back and leased another for
14983	Highly recommend - beautiful ride.
14988	I had a Prius.
14989	Its like going from a Cobalt to a Cadillac.
14999	For this car purchase, I only considered hybrid cars.
15000	I wanted something with great MPG but was also well-appointed.
15008	A quality touring sedan that's a pleasure to drive with outstanding gas mileage in hybrid trim.
15019	I Highly Recommend this car
15024	Would do it again but maybe XLE just for the seating but all the extras were not worth the $$ for us.
15031	So far no rattles in 1 year usage (11,000 miles).
15032	Absolutely rock solid at this point.
15037	Very comfortable driving.
15038	Comfy comfy ride for passengers.
15043	This is a great car.
15051	Before the Camry I owned the 2008 Prius and the take-off power with the Camry is significantly better and feels equivalent to my V8 Dodge Ram truck.
15052	Also the transition from engine to electric only is a lot smoother than the prius (barely noticeable) and
15057	Just a sweet vehicle, I got an XLE Hybrid with all the options.
15059	Has great interior and feature-packed dash.
15060	Very roomy--i'm 6'3and 300
15065	Overall Excellent Value for the money, Best overall Hybrid vehicle after doing months of research
15070	This is a great car with remarkable pick-up for a Hybrid.
15076	Just a great economical family car that does everything well and gets great mileage.
15097	I love my Corolla 14!!!
15102	It's a great car overall.
15103	I enjoy driving it and it gets great mileage.
15104	Again my only complaints are with being misled on some features and not having others offered to me, but that is on the dealer.
15109	This is the best car I have ever owned.
15110	It is great to drive and I feel so safe in it.
15115	It's a great car.
15120	I really think it's the best one yet.
15121	Great power for lane changes unlike the 13 (which I did also own) it will def get you out of a spot.
15122	Gas is amazing, I can drive and drive and the needle won't move.
15128	Work in city and live in suburbs, never a complaint on gas mileage, power, style, reliability.
15135	This 2014 drives nothing like the 2013 Corolla.
15137	It drives like a dream and the inside is GORGEOUS.
15138	I have Bluetooth and the awesome back up camera that has come in handy already!
15139	All in all I am very pleased with this
15149	I am very pleased with this car.
15150	It has all of the features I was searching for and more.
15151	The built in camera and blue tooth is very convenient.
15152	My kids are also content and like my car because it is easy to learn how to use and has simple instructions.
15162	Great car
15167	I hope the 14 will run for 20 years like my 94 has.
15172	Best car I ever owned
15177	Buy one!!!
15178	You won't be sorry.
15193	Solid capable feel - feels like a tank that can do anything, and go anywhere.
15198	Can't wait to go camping in it.
15204	While it was fun to drive, I'd recommend the Auto if you buy one.
15210	I just got mine and loving every minute of it!
15221	This vehicle is a reliable friend in ugly weather, powering through snow
15226	Don't just buy this vehicle for its looks.
15227	It's a keeper.
15240	I can't speak more highly of the engineering of this truck.
15241	I am so glad that I didn't take the  negativereviews of the professionals all that seriously and went wi
15246	Owing a FJ is a blast and you can take them anywhere.
15248	Off Road - The FJ starts drooling at the idea of going Off Road.Mud - The FJ slurps mud and spits it out with ease.
15256	You pay for the name Lexus, yes some of the features are a little plusher on the Lexus but it isn't worth the cost.
15261	If you want a reliable and luxurious SUV under 40k, this is a good place to start.
15266	Overall though I am 100% pleased.
15273	I would give it a ten!
15274	If I had to buy another tomorrow, it would be another Highlander.
15279	Would buy another Highlander today.
15284	Saftey is most important when it comes to my family, the Highlander proved it was worth the money
15289	Saftey is most important when it comes to my family, the Highlander proved it was worth the money
15294	Buy it !
15306	You can keep you Lexus..I'll take the Highlander Limited any time!
15321	If you want room to haul kids and gear with a great ride, this is the vehicle for you.
15326	JUST GO BUY IT, YOU WONT REGRET IT, I SAW THE 2014 AT THE NEW YORK SHOW AND IT LOOKS LIKE A RAV 4 ON STEROIDS, IT LOOKED FANTASTIC.
15331	great car for the family we feel safe in it
15336	This was the first brand new vehicle my husband and I purchased (I'm 24 he's 28).
15337	We have two kids and were looking for a vehicle that had the optional third row seating and for me a/c vents in the third row was a must.
15343	Excellent purchase and value
15350	I use it for business and love it.
15351	This is my second Highlander and it saves me lots of fuel and service costs over my previous Jeep Grand Cherokees (had 6).
15361	Suits our needs and wonderful crossover.
15362	I'll review more in the future after more miles.
15378	2nd Landcruiser purchased, 1st was a 2009 and thisseems a little quieter inside.
15379	Use on beach surf fishing.No problem thru snow or sand.
15385	Best of all cars I have owned and they number 14.
15390	Great SUV, we did two long trips from Texas to Redwoods CA and to West Virginia... really a great one to own....
15401	My wife and I are in our seventies and purchased this vehicle more for its comfort, safety features, and stability on the highway than the all terrain features.
15402	We have owned three other Toyotas in the past and never had any negative problems.
15408	Excellent, safe, reliable, and durable vehicle.
15413	I go everywhere in my cruiser.
15414	I have had 5 now and this is my first with the 5.7.
15415	Pulls all my toys great and works well in sand or ice.
15416	Have used winch a few times to get me out of swamp and it just kept on going.
15421	Worth every penny.
15422	Driven my in all kinds of weather.
15423	Solid as a rock
15430	The vehicle handles very well and is a joy to drive.
15435	AN EXCELLENT CAR EVERY BODY SHOULD DRIVE
15440	Best auto Ive ever owned of this type,.
15441	sporty enough, practical and reliable.
15454	Overall, I am very pleased with my Toyota Prius II.
15455	Despite some harsh criticism, the Prius has been an excellent, reliable family car that has saved me time and money.
15456	The Blue Tooth is great and the basic audio system just fine for me.
15462	Excellent car, every home has to have one, you will save a lot
15467	I would never buy any other car but another prius I have had 20 brand new cars during my life from Lincoln mark 7 to volkswages to 5 buicks and others will only but Toyota from now on
15472	Great car and we get 60 miles to the gallon We are senior citizens and we enjoy the not having to spend money on gas
15477	I have owned 3 new Priuses and had very good fuel mileage with my 2010 and 2011 Prius.
15479	I have close to 7000 miles on it and I think it should be doing much better.
15485	This is the most technologically advanced car I have ever owned and we plan on getting many years of clean economical driving out of it.
15486	For those with a 20 mile or less commute, it is an outstanding choice.
15491	Very good car that serves my needs really well.
15492	It's great for short (EV mode) and long trips (HV mode), it saves a lot of money on gas, and it's just so fun to drive it on electricity!
15504	This is my 3rd one.
15505	2013 discount of $3000 off plus 0% saved me another $1700.
15506	Total savings $4700 not counting gas savings.
15514	Downsized from a 15 mpg 2005 Honda Pilot to a 2013 Prius II that I bought for a very reasonable $20,995 + tax.
15516	Owned too many cars to mention, but the Prius is one of my favorites (just under the
15521	After having owned the Cmax for 10 months and 15K miles, I traded it in for this Prius.
15522	My goal was to get a gas sipper that had a good safety rating.
15523	So I traded for the Prius.
15524	And I'm glad I did.
15530	After 2 years and 60k miles - we made the best choice - saved so much $$$ - both Prius' we own are fantastic not one repair or maint issue after all these miles - I expect to get 300,000 miles on these cars.
15536	i am still smiling and enjoying the ride (even knowing that i am driving to work).
15537	Love the smart key and door touch locking.
15539	(gas station once a month).
15540	I sent a Thank You Note to Toyota.
15546	So far all of our experience with this Prius have been positive.
15561	I bought one the next week.This car is designed fo
15566	If you often take short trips of 15 miles or less this is the car for you.
15567	The hatchback and rear seat fold down to produce a massive amount of storage capacity.
15568	The technology in the car is amazing.
15569	With a regular plug in it takes only 3 hours to rechar
15584	Well worth the money if nothing else in the gas savings alone.
15591	Exactly what I was looking for better than I expected!!
15596	Overall I am very pleased and am already planning for my next one.
15612	would/will buy again when this one is no longer driveable.
15613	I have owned toyota vehicles since 1997 and have always been satisfied.
15618	Great product for the money
15623	Best and most efficient vehicle I have ever had.
15624	I love my new Prius!
15634	First car I have owned that Del.
15635	what the Manufactory promised, and I have owned a lot of cars.
15640	The only regret is not buying 10 years ago.
15646	I have owned the Prius (package 2/II) 2005, 2008, 2011, and now the Persona 2013 (Black Cherry is awsome).
15647	The 2013 is by far a superior product although I miss my 2005 for other reasons.
15648	Previous to owning a Prius, I owned a 199
15653	I have owned my Prius III for just over 1000 miles which is hardly enough time to give an extensive review, but enough to give a fair first impression.
15667	This is my second Prius, the first one I drove for 7 years with no problems.
15668	I bought the new one fully loaded and haven't regreted my decision for a moment.
15680	The PriusC is a great car, it gets great gas mpg.
15681	It drives excellant, It is a good car to own.
15688	Great little car , does what I need it to do .
15698	Twenty-five hundred kilometers on it so far and I am still over the moon.
15699	Averaging 60 miles to the Imperial gallon, nimble in town and great legs on the highway.
15700	As Goldilocks said, this one is just right!
15706	I purchased this vehicle with a very specific purpose in mind and it has been exactly what I needed it to be.
15707	I drive roughly 100 miles per day and make a 500+ mile trip once a month or so...lots of miles, and it's usually just m
15712	first new car, and it was such a wise choice.
15714	definintely the right car for me.
15720	It may not be the sportiest or fastest car in town but it is fun to drive, has great mileage and has extended service life.
15726	Great economical car
15731	Buy it.
15737	Wish they hadn't gone cheap with some of the stuff normally considered standard now.
15743	Its some of the most bang for the buck you can get for a full hybrid vehicle that can do electric-only driving below 30-40 mph f
15748	I would definitely buy another one.
15764	I highly recommend this car.
15765	It drives like a luxury vehicle - very smooth handling on the road.
15770	I bought this vehicle because I wanted a small wagon that got good gas mileage with ample cargo space to haul all of our stuff to our vacation home in the summer.
15777	Would recommend this car to anyone looking for a gas sipping cross country hauler.
15782	The car rides well and gets excellent gas mileage and the bells and whistles associated with the audio, Bluetooth, and built-in GPS are wonderful - easy to set-up and easy to use.
15788	Highly recommend it!
15794	Overall, I love the vehicle and have recommended it to many people.
15795	It can be somewhat confusing to go between my wife's Camry Hybrid and the Prius with the different gear shifts...
15800	This is a great car if you can get over the weak engine struggling when you need to accelerate for highway or city driving.
15805	Owned for 2 weeks.
15809	He sat in the seat behind me (I'm '6) and didn't complain at all.
15810	The back seat sli
15815	I like this car - have had it a little over a year without any problems.
15816	Drove it from Texas to Virginia and back with 2 adults, 1 child, and 2 dogs and was comfortable and roomy.
15817	Don't miss stopping for gas every 4 or 5 days!
15822	Excellent car great MPG's lots of cargo room give it a   10 in spite of the flaws.
15827	I just recomimend it for someone who wants reliableble transportationi.
15832	I'm really happy with this vehicle, would recommend it over all the similar station wagon type cars I looked at.
15833	Driving a   hybrid turned out to be easy, love the gas savings too.
15838	I'm really happy with this vehicle, would recommend it over all the similar station wagon type cars I looked at.
15839	Driving a   hybrid turned out to be easy, love the gas savings too.
15844	Excellent car.
15854	great vehicle
15861	When we looked at all the  details- it was the QUALITY that sold us on the RAV
15866	Frankly, I felt like I was riding a hearse, yet alone an SUV.
15868	I have an original version from the 1990's and closing in on 500,000 miles with only
15873	Have only had this car for two weeks so far but love it in mostly every respect.
15890	Despite the cons, when comparing the RAV4 to other SUVs, I keep coming back to the RAV4.
15891	I have NEVER had a RAV4 (except for battery dying) break down.
15897	sharp looking and great SUV for the price
15902	Had a 2010 Rav4 Sport-really liked the car, but ride was too stiff with Sport suspension and run flat tires.
15903	My new XLE rides smmoth, seats are more comfortable and interior is upgraded.
15904	2010 Rav had tiny backup camera in rear view mirror, now pic is on
15914	Overall its' a nice ride, Things can be changed or upgraded, Its' a first year model remake, so they can work out the bugs.
15915	Hopefully this will last me for a long time.
15916	I can live with it..
15924	The right size for a small active family.
15925	Very disappointed in Toyota quality on this Rav4.
15930	Im not totally satisfied with this car.
15935	I had this as a rental while my 2012 escape was being looked at (not fixed, just looked at for the 3rd time) I fell in love with it.
15947	I never did want to get a crossover, but my wife did and she deserves what she wants.
15954	Very fun car to drive, The 2.5L had more getup-n-go then I expected.
15955	Also the dealer experience was very pleasant.
15961	Drives and handles well, nicely styled and sporty, has great space and controls, with good gas mileage.
15966	Styling, dash controls, the power of the engine and the options are great, well satisfied.
15971	great car
15981	The new rav4 has improved in seating comfort and driving position, but acceleration is just adequate with eco mode off, and downright slow with it on.
15988	Based on what I've experienced in my newer 2013 model, I am pleased with the vehicle but am waiting for the inevitable dee
16010	So very glad I bought it!
16015	*I love mine after 1 full month Very happy I bought it!
16025	Great to own, fun to drive.
16030	super nice to drive
16035	would recommend this vehicle
16040	Overall very happy after 3000 miles.
16042	It takes some time to get used to the 4 cylinder power - but in reality its quite peppy due to the gearing.
16043	The ride is a bit choppy, but chock thi
16053	Great handling
16060	If you are looking for something bigger than a car, but not as big as an suv.
16066	Nice style, Toyota quality for the most part, but just feels overall cheaper then previous models, not as solid.
16072	We are very happy with it.
16077	good for kids and seniors
16082	I am a very happy owner!
16092	Great value for the money in all aspects.
16113	Great bang for the buck, I almost bought a Subaru and hadn't even considered the RAV4.
16119	A near excellent vehicle.....
16125	I have the 2013 Toyota Rav4 Limited.
16126	Will never go back to a sedan model!
16127	The Rav has a lot of pep, and handles beautifully on turns!
16144	The RAV4 eliminates the concern by offering a hand lever instead, much better.. No reason to consider the Hond
16154	Love the looks and handling.
16165	Overall I am very pleased with the RAV 4
16170	I previously owned a 2004 RAV4 and never had any trouble out of it.
16185	Has all I need for lifestyle driving, both in-town and on the road.
16199	The Sienna was not lacking in power, and it handles as you would expect a minivan to.
16210	I would rate the Sienna tops for a minivan.
16232	I have owned Minivans since they first came into the market,I must say we have come a long ways from when it started.
16244	Bought my first Tacoma Aug. 2013 last week received recall notice informing me that the top of the engine has to be ripped off to replace all the valve springs.
16251	The things that I find wrong with this vehicle can be fixed and seem to be minor.
16252	The overall ride and handling are great and true to the Toyota name.
16253	I'm in the process of getting some of the cons fixed..I hope anyway.
16258	I purchased the Tacoma Double cab with TRD off-road pkg for $430 below invoice.
16259	That said, this truck is great even with the cons noted.
16261	I liked the look and feel of the in
16266	I still bought the Tacoma.
16267	Yes, preferred the Nissan ride more.
16270	Not having Satellite Radio capability is perplexing.
16276	I got the TRD sports package and love the way it looks.
16291	Very satisfying vehicle for my use except for not having intermittent wipers.
16293	trip toggling the switch constantly to clear small amounts of rain.
16298	Best truck I have ever owned !
16303	Great truck, looks good, drives good and will last forever
16308	I personally couldn't be more pleased with my new truck.
16309	This vehicle is truely worth the price!
16320	Lots of features that others don't have, but the ones that it does have could have been improved to keep customer in mind.
16326	And has been proven to be very reliable, I would choosea Tacoma.
16337	I like this vehicle very much, it takes time to get use to the size of it.
16338	even though I got screwed on the car trade which we all do I would highly recommend this vehicle
16343	Best truck I've ever owned...so long Silverado!
16344	If you want a truck that's got all the bells and whistles, is realiable, gets good fuel economy and can still tow a fair amount this is the truck for you.
16350	Traded my 2005 Tacoma Double Cab 4x4 Long Bed SR5 I bought brand new off the lot in OCT 2005 for a 2013 Tacoma Double Cab 4x4 Long Bed TRD Sport brand new off the lot in FEB 2013.Reason (My Opinions) why I gave the following categories a score of 10.Styl
16355	ONE WORD - BEST !!!!!!
16360	Great truck tows my implement trailer (lawnmowers) like theres nothing there.
16361	I would recommend this truck to anyone that needs a truck and wants to get decent mileage.
16377	I LOVE IT
16382	Great truck for the money, traded in a 2011 scion tc which i bought new as well and it was the best idea i have had.
16383	The car was fantastic but owning a tacoma is just something peopel should experience.
16384	Great syle, great milage, good off road handling, a
16390	Never would have thought a truck could feel so refined.
16391	Traded in my 2011 scion tc for this truck, and has a 10x smoother ride than the tc.
16411	Overall, I simply can't reccomend this truck, the value is just not there.
16412	My dealership replaced both air induction pumps free of charge, of course, but rushed me in and out like I was part of some covert operation..which I guess I was.
16418	I would dare to say this is the best 4x4 on the road period.
16419	The big three need to take notice as this truck will out perform them
16425	I would recommend it to anyone who wants a great truck.
16431	This is my second Tundra and after reviewing all the trucks in this segment th
16447	The 5.7 I have now is much more powerful.
16455	Awesome buy, would recommend to anyone!
16460	Even though the truck is a bit outdated, build quality makes up for its short coming.
16473	Excellent truck, very comfortable and great looks.
16480	I'm pleased; no government motors in my near future!
16490	If you are looking to buy a truck, do yourself a favor and take a look at the Tundra.
16496	Be prepared for a firm ride...corners well, handles like cars that have a much lower stance.
16510	I believe this is a very good vehicle for someone who needs the versatility of an SUV without sacrificing the gas milage and handling of a larger vehicle.
16512	For me, it has exceeded my expectations.
16523	I test drove many cars, cross-overs and SUVs before I settled on my Venza 10 months ago.
16524	Given what I paid for it and the subsequent low cost to own this car (insurance, registration, fuel costs, etc.)
16525	I am so glad I purchased it.
16526	I would do it all over
16535	Settled on the V6 AWD.
16548	For the price I paid and what I got for my money I could not be happier.
16549	My insurance is very reasonable.
16550	Toyota's 24-month maintenance free program is great; something I never got from Ford or GM.
16556	No matter how luxurious this car looks, it is not safe.
16557	It is impossible to see behind you or on the side while driving, especially at night.
16558	My lease is only 10 months old and I am looking to find another car to trade because it is so unsafe.
16564	Like it better than a Mercedes SUV.We love this car.
16574	The styling, cavernous interior cargo with seats folding flat at the flip of a lever, excellent gas mileage for it's size (I4-AWD) and Toyota reliability won me over in spite of this one major downside...I wish I could have gotten the sunroof too!
16580	I would definetly buy another.
16581	Dealer Service has been Excellent; Five Star
16586	I would definetly buy another.
16597	The 2013 Venza is what it should have been from the beginning.
16598	It is a great looking, great riding wagon that flies in the face of the station wagons of yore.
16599	Stylish with aggressive 20 inch wheels, the 2013 Venza makes owning such a class of car fun, so
16604	I had my 2013 since Aug. of 2012 and do not regret buying this vehicle.
16612	I had a 2010 Venza v-6, AWD which I like very much.
16613	I replaced it witha 2013 with most of the same features.
16615	I would buy this car again.
16620	love it!
16630	The most dependable car I have ever owned.
16631	No frills, but a dependable car that gets you from point A to point B.
16636	I like it, I would buy it again.
16637	My friends make fun of my little   clown car but whatever....I walk away with more money in my wallet.
16638	I am happy with it.
16644	I will purchase another one if i move to a summer climate city.
16649	very stylish and i would recommend this to newly weds
16654	I own a denim blue and get compliments and thumbs up quite often when driving down the street.
16656	Everyone who drives it loves it !
16661	I drove a Nissan Pathfinder for about 12 years.
16662	It was my primary vehicle.
16663	Gas was expensive because The LE version only takes high octane gas.
16665	I also experienced other problems with my pathfinder.
16671	Its great, fun and enjoyable to drive
16676	The TDI is a surprise gutsy performer.
16677	15000 miles and no service problems.
16682	I had a bug in the 60's and do not know why it took me so long to buy another.
16683	Love the German influence and technology
16688	AWESOME :)
16693	I love my beetle and would buy another one today.
16698	Handles a lot better than I thought it would.
16709	I HAVE A 2013 CONVERTIBLE..LOVE IT !!!!
16714	The best looking convertible and fun to drive
16719	Fun to drive, even TDI is fast.
16722	But mostly it is fun to drive, easy and fast to put top up or down and more room than you would think.
16729	With the Turbo, eats the mountain roads.
16731	Very comfortable interior too.
16736	It's my first German vehicle (previously owned Acura, Toyota, Nissan, and Jeep) and I LOVE IT!
16737	Trust me, the car shines best at night when all the lights are on with the panoramic moon roof tilted up.
16738	This car isn't the fastest kid on the block, but it s
16748	my car 2009 brought in dec,2008
16759	For the price I think its a great car, looks great will turn heads and nice ride, does not have some features that I felt should be included but over all the CC is a good deal.
16769	im satisfied with my purchase overall
16784	Negatives out weigh the positives.
16789	Best bang for the bucks...especially if you can get your hands on a 2013 this christmas...
16794	I have owned a lot of cars, from Hondas to Acuras to Saabs, and this is without question the most fun to drive, best looking, quietest car I have ever owned.
16799	I got CC Jan. 2013...
16800	This is my first German car... so far I liked it style and engine performance...
16805	Love driving the car and the RNS 510 nav system is wonderful...love the sound system the way it plays Jazz on a long commute home or road trip.
16816	I was sold on the appearance without the price of a Mercedes.
16822	Would recommend to anyone who wants a great car at a sensible price.
16827	I researched tons of cars in the same class, and I'm completely thrilled with my purchase.
16828	This car turns heads - in-fact I had someone at a gas station tell me what a wonderful job Mercedes has done with this car .
16836	Tested and researched many cars before finding this.
16837	First European purchase and I'm glad I did...
16842	very nice car to have.
16847	Great value (for what I was looking for in a car).I have put over 30,000 miles on my CC and still enjoy it as much as day one.
16857	This is a very nice automobile.
16858	For just two people and our small dog it should be a car that we will enjoy for years to come.
16859	Also, the dealership we dealt with has made owning the car very enjoyable, and that can't be said for some of the dealerships w
16866	I live in the northwest, and the main drawback of convertibles is they are kind of yucky in t
16877	I am very surprised I don't see more of them on the road.
