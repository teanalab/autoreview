1 better warranty
1 the 2013 gmc terrain based upon admittedly short experience has proven to be excellent
1 it is a good value at the price--i received 0% financing and a $500 rebate

1 it really is a beautiful car and rides beautiful
1 i wouldn't trade it for the !
2 i figure that it is a trade offif you want good gas mileage buy a compact or a hybrid
3 if you want something more comfortable but lower gas mileage the terrain fits the bill
1 the terrain is a great all-rounderand has ample room for a 3 or 4 person family

1 highly recommended
2 i droved comfortable sport cars and coupes prior to buying this crv so it is very uncomortable to sit upright

1 great car
1 looking forward to getting 250000 outa this one
1 excellent car for the money
2 however when one adds trim and options it gets pricey

1 good for use around town but don't take it on a trip unless you want a back ache and ringing in your ears
1 i really like this car
1 very stylisheasy to drive
2 we were concerned that switching from our honda accord ex-v6 to the honda cr-v would cost us more to operate
1 but we were pleasantly surprised that our cr-v actually gets better mileage than our accord
2 needs side warning lights on mirrors
1 i love driving !
1 the price was great the gas mileage is better than most
1 i would recommend this suv to others and family members
1 great job !
2 :
1 this is my 5th honda after 3 civics and a pilot ex-l awd
2 i did prefer the pilot but not the 17-18 mpg
1 i am getting 25+ mpg in the cr-v in a blend of stop-and-go and highway driving which is good for an awd vehicle
2 haven't had a chance to really test
1 is excellent for running around town and short trips down the interstate
1 is not a high end ride but very well equipped
3 i am 6 foot if you are taller you might have a problem with driver leg room

1 the ability to think like that is always a joy to behlod
2 this is my first suv and i love !

2 out of my fourth honda
2 three civics and this element
1 i think the element is best so far
1 i don't have to twist my back up for access
1 i love the design

1 a very good suv
1 it has honda engineering

1 it feels safe but it does have a high profileoverall a good buy
1 they evidently last a long time as well
1 if you take a serious look at the way you drive and you find that your real needs are multi purpose functional and reliabilty then the element should be considered
3 you can add a few creature comforts along the way as most do with their cars
3 the cost
1 people have frequently asked me how i like my car and i probably bore them to tears extolling the virtues of the honda element
1 i have put very little money into this car other than the normal wear and tear type things
2 spent only about $1000 in 9 years and 178000 miles since 2003
1 a great vehicle for carrying anything from a tv to dogs
1 all great features
2 this is a car that i would buy again but probably won't have to because of honda's record of durabilaty
1 a car i would recommend highlylot's of interior spacegood mpgattractive design in the sport packagecar is a lot of fun to drive and has all the features i needed for a commuter car and it's peace of mind because it's a honda

1 great mid sized suv
1 great car
3 we have only had our trailhawk for 2 weeks now but have been in thick sand off roading on trails and in snow
1 it handled them all amazingly
1 it is better looking in person
1 photographs don't do it justice

2 review id:
1 decent ride and capable jeep
1 but even for 55k it is still a jeep
2 tens of thousands cheaper than range rover with the same options but will be in the shop as much as a range rover
3 however with the range rover you will at least have service reps pretend
2 had the vehicle for 3 days and the electronic dash board went blank
2 restarted the car 3 times and it came back on
2 6 days later the navigation system went blank
3 had to pull over turn the car off and it came back on
2 a week later the radio screen froze
1 one of the best cars i have owned with lots of features
1 i have not had any problems with the jeep in 7 months of ownership
1 the grand cherokee is an excellent choice we were considering several vehicles in the same segment when we decided to go with the grand cherokee and i wouldn't have it any other way
1 overall i'm been completely statisfied with my 2014 gc overland
1 no major problems
3 advise- read the manuals and know your build !
1 4k on it so far and i still really like the looks of the gcthe 8 speed tranny is nice except at low acceleration it's a little lungy getting from 1st to 4th gearit tows my atv's with ease with the 57l hemi; although that comes at a price at the pump
2 save your money and from being very disappointed and buy something else
1 overall its a great truck - it's a shame they couldn't get the electronics right before releasing it

1 i am very pleased with this vehicle which replaced my 11 year old grand cherokee
1 i liked the old one but this is a step up in terms of luxury and performance

1 thanks to jeep's cash incentives and dealership discounts the price of this new vehicle was a bargain
1 the ride and handling of the liberty are fantastic for a truck-based suv and i can't understand why

1 my friend does though so hey at least hes happy
2 i rented one of these for a week in hawaii and i wanted to share my experienceall vehicles are tradeoffs - you trade weight for space or gas mileage for performance
2 however this seems to be a vehicle with all downsides while offering no benefits in
1 great suv amazingly capable and reminds me of previous cherokee
2 despite poor gas mileage you won't be driving the new cherokee disappointment set out by jeep

3 i like the fact it's built in ohio with a great deal of domestic content and american labor

2 was about to purchase a 2013 avalon ltd but looked at es 350 and agreed to buy the same day
1 although the avalon and es 350 share numerous systems the overall driving experience in the es 350 is well worth the extra $3k to $4k
1 this is not a car- this is a fine !
1 the ride is quiet and comfortable; my gas mileage seems to be better than quoted; and it takes regular unleaded vs

1 it's wonderful a lot of people love the color and style 
1 love it love it  love it
3 i was in the market for a family car
2 must have driven the dealers mad in my community
2 it came down to this and honda accord
2 i am sad to say i went with honda as this is definitely better looking but the cons became the deal breaker
2 don't get me wron
1 this is an exceptional car
1 i am in the market for a car and this definitely is in top 3
1 understated luxury that is classy
1 just with a few tweaks and it is a no brainer
1 the 2014 mazda 6 is the working man's exotic sports !
1 its voluptuous curves cavernous interior and above grade fit and finish lets it stand out in a crowded field of full size sedans
2 the competition from the ford fusion honda accord toyota cam
1 highly recommended
1 it rides better than the accord/altima with junky cvt
1 automatic trans works very well
1 one of my top 5 picks to buy
1 mazda is has created a vehicle that provides best in market value along with a vehicle that is fun to drive
1 excellent car for the money good quality feels solid
1 excellent car
1 did i say the gas mileage is ?
1 i am 100% satisfied
1 very simply amazing getting 325 mpg mostly around town wish it had a tad more zoom but understand that's a trade off for the 325 mpg
1 love the !
1 anybody looking for a mid-sized car would be making a big mistake by not looking at this car
1 it is simply far and away above the camry accord sonata optima altima and fusion
2 i chose the mazda 6 over the nissan altima and subaru legacy because it had and style and the features i liked best
1 it's a great car and i'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new car
1 an excellent looking and fun to drive sedan
1 mazda's redesign of the 6 is simply stunning and the value delivered both in fuel economy and in safety features is really compelling
2 my reommendation is to test drive it
1 once you do you will end up buying it
1 the only fault i can find in the 2014 mazda 6 is that it is taking me a little time to adjust to the difference in power after owning a 2011 grand touring with the v6
2 the 25 gas is more than sufficient for any type of driving unless you are like me and
2 i compared with camry accord and altima and decided to go with 6
1 i'm happy i made that decision
1 the 2014 mazda 6 is the clear choice for those looking for an overall nice vehicle which is fun to drive
3 it has many technological advances with luxury sedan safety features
1 young or old you'll love the new mazda 6
1 best new mazda in !
1 do your self a favor and at least test drive the mazda 6 before you decide to buy any other car
1 great !
1 i love !
1 great !

2 after several weeks of researching my next purchase it came down to the mazda 6 and the honda accord sport but in the end i ended up buying the mazda

1 great car fun to drive
1 i love this car
1 i've owned 4 mazdas and each one just gets better and better
2 out of all the cars out there this one just did not work for me
2 if i just wanted a dd it still would not be the speed3 and as far as performance its useless
1 with the tech package you get everything you can wish for in a car for under $30k
2 according to experts out there this car is a race car so not for the beginner
1 lots of power but will remain calm and composed if driven as such
1 lots of fun to drive and commands respect on the road
1 i do recommend getting this if you want something cheap and quick its a great car to have as your 2nd car
1 its a solid car and really enjoyable to drive
2 this car punches way out of it's price range and should not be sold or loaned to anyone under 25 with out close adult supervision
1 great little hot hatch if you want performance for the money i would highly recommend this car and if you can swing it get one with the tech packagei love !

1 owned many cars and suv's this could be the most fun suv i've driven
1 great
2 we have not bought a new car in years and researched alot and drove alot of suv's
1 this lived up to our expectations
3 it won suv of the year in a car !
2 overrated will not let you state your opinion 
1 this vehicle is hard to beat for it's price
1 this is another reason why subaru sales are soaring
1 great suv
1 highly recommend the car
2 must have to go up to the snow
1 a great little car that feels bigger than it is excellent fuel economy and handling
1 here in the midwest the awd comes in real handy snow rain freezing rain you never know what you'll get i ski bike and kayak the roof racks and storage are great
1 i absolutely love this car in the hatchback
1 i use it as a city car in nyc and it fits that role perfectly
1 it handles great takes potholes like a champ
1 the visibility while driving is perfect and i feel like i can see everything that is going on aroun
1 a great car if you want a car that feels big and still gives you mpg and awd at a great price
1 love !
1 safe zippy small tough reliable
1 overall this is a wonderful car for me as i drive it back and forth to work daily
1 i save on fuel costs with the fuel efficiency it offers and i don't have to worry about the weather conditions with the all-wheel drive
1 so it is safe and economical
2 an
1 great deal all around i looked at vw tdi wagons and their premium price tag was not worth the extra 2 mpg's
1 great car
1 excellent car although acceleration is slow handling and breaking is very good
1 i get about 32 mpg combined which is excellent for an awd car
1 the car looks good and is very simple which is good for reliability
1 it will get you where you need to go in
2 i wanted a compact wagon or hatchback with all wheel drive
1 not too many of those from which to choose but the impreza suits my needs perfectly
1 i can park it easily in the city i get the advertised 36 mpg on the highway where i spend much of my time
1 im used to high perfomance 200+ hp but this is the first time ive actually been impressed with the impreza
1 its great all around because with the awd you dont feel the lag from fwd cars when you accelerate
2 people now days mostly need to sprint to 40mph
1 if it's not for the oil consumption i love this car
1 most fuel efficient and economical all wheel drivevehicle out there for a best buy !
1 now i hear the xvcrosstrek will be produced as a hybrid in 2014 which will make leaps and bounds for the subaru name as being a fuel efficient economical automobile
1 very good small car
1 does great in the snow
1 very pleased with this car
1 great little 5 door hatchback
2 i have yet to buy a new car with good tires
2 there are far better tires that cost less than the stockones that came with this car
1 road noise level much reduced with tire change out
3 handling also improved and snow traction
1 the awd and safety features gives a very secure feeling when driving
1 excellent gas milage considering it has all wheel drive
2 i average around 30 mpg in the city
1 simple and reliable
1 comfortable and spacious for passengers with excellent cargo versatil
2 i had this car for couple days when my 09 impreza sedan was in for service
1 at first i was not impressed with the car even though the interior was a good improvement over the previous generation subarus
1 i'm not a fan of hatchbacks but after driving it
1 versatile !
2 i own a 2011 sti hatch
1 with plenty of hp awd brembo brakes and tuned sport suspension it's a real performer
1 great fun and you can drive it in the wintersti and snow tires is there anything more ?
1 seriously consider this car for the 25-30k rangegreat feel easy to drive great performance when you need it in awd
1 while not the perfect car its engine awd and suspension more than makes up for its deficiencies
1 its rally heritage can be felt and it gives the driver a raw and exciting feeling of a true drivers car
1 to get this feel usually requires paying much more
1 if you enjoy the driving experience while keeping practicality this is the car for you
2 the 265 turbo-charged 4cyl engine will push you back in your seat with virtually no turbo-lag but at normal driving speeds you'll get about 25 mpg
1 very comfortab
1 i think i will injoy this car for years to come
1 love this car can't ever imaging owning anything but a subaru
1 get this car cant beat the value for the price and the gas milage
3 just because it's awd you will for sure need snow tires
2 the tires they come with are summer tiresafter adding snow tires winter driving is way better
1 i would recommend the legacy to everyone out there looking for a dependable and affordable !
1 good family car
2 what i have come to expect from subaru
1 overall i'm very happy with the legacy

2 this is my first subaru ever after 20 years of toyotas so the bar is set pretty high

1 we've only had the crosstrek for a few weeks and it is awesome
