75	No complaints!
85	i would definately recommend this truck

101	The GMC Sierra is on another level in terms of ride and interior quality.
102	The 6.2 liter v8 is a monster.
113	Great Truck.

302	Love it!!
307	Traded in a 2008 Ford Edge Limited for a 2013 GMC Terrain Denali and truly loved that I went with the deanali tag.
308	It really is a beautiful car and rides BEAUTIFUL.
314	I figure that it is a trade off...if you want good gas mileage, buy a compact or a hybrid.
315	If you want something more comfortable, but lower gas mileage, the terrain fits the bill.
320	The Terrain is a great all-rounderand has ample room for a 3 or 4 person family.
321	It reminds me of the classic station-wagon, a sadly defunct class of cars that were a good compromise between a sedan and a van.Don't expect sports sedan handling or acce

484	Overall very nice vehicle.
492	I would to see a litte more HP.. GMC you did a good job onm this truck and how to use it.
498	However, I think GMC needs to add the guidelines with the rear back up camera.
499	Most vehicles have this feature when they have the backup camera for the vehicle.
500	I would think this would be an added safety feature of the veh
505	I hope the makers consider correcting the problems I mentioned above.
541	Would recommend for anyone.

1256	If you are looking for value, comfort, safety, reliability, resale value, and good performance then the Honda CR-V deserves a serious look.
1263	However, it is a quality built and reliable reasonable priced vehicle.
1264	It is more suited to a smaller person as my wife.
1278	Looking forward to getting 250000 outa this one
1284	However when one adds trim and options it gets pricey.

1322	I would recommend this SUV to others and family members.

2350	Better visibility in another car would not compensate
2355	some good &some bad things = only a fair car I hope this trend of cheaper materials & higherr prices ends soon.
2362	The Elantra is a near unbeatable car.
2364	It is still nice to drive.
2365	It is NICE to drive, not EXCITING to drive.
2376	Get this car you won't be disappointed.

2378	Gas mileage is great so far.
2384	Love the car.
2385	Unless Hyundai starts producing horrible cars, I will probably buy a new one in about 5 years.
2390	In order to get great mileage (as advertised) you can't have a heavy foot during excelleration.
2396	I love this car!
2397	Definitely would recommend it as a commuter.
2402	Overall I am dissapointed with the gas mileage in the city.
2407	Other that the MPG this car is great.
2414	Hyundai seems to understand that good customer service is what sells cars and keeps customers coming back.
2419	I have a whole new view of Hyundai automotive engineering capability.
2420	These guys are off the charts where it counts!

2542	I have given my salesmans card to several people and I would suggest that people really look at this car as their next purchase
2547	A great car for the price
2554	Hyundai needs to work on a permanent solution to cosmetics with regard to the finish of the paint and
2560	No get up and go.
2566	Overall, this is an excellent car for the money.

2627	Pretty car.
2635	I find it hard to believe all these people saying they are only getting 25 to 28 MPG with this car.
2636	They must be serious led foots.
2637	I drive mainly around town with little to no highway driving and I've never gotten below 28.

2689	so far cant say anything bad about the car very comfortable riding car and for the price you cant beat it
2696	Again, do not listen to the MPG knuckleheads.
2697	They obviously do not know how to drive efficiently.
2702	Mileage is great.
2703	On a recent highway trip, I was up to 42 mpg.
2708	Nice carif you want to save money on gas
2713	LOVE THE CAR
2718	for designer n future lovers... the best car...not for driving lovers
2744	The fit & finish are very impressive for a car in this price range.
2745	Since this is a new addition to the Elantra line, there's not a whole lot of info about this specific model as yet.

2845	EVERYTHING SEEM VERY GOOD ABOUT THE CAR I LIKE THE GOOD WARANTY TOOI test drove 6 different car before deciding to buy the Elantra, the 2nd best one for me was Mazda 3 but not enough space and the drive was not has smooth.
2850	I absolutely love this car!

2932	Would definately recommend this auto to anyone who is looking for a smaller utility vehicle with the ability to haul a nice sized load or fits very good and versital for a small family.
2937	Add another gear to the automatic transmission and it will be perfect.
2947	Be careful what you buy, and be sure not to buy any cars from Rex Perry Auto Plex in Texas.
2959	Next car will get much better mileage.
2960	Would not by again.
2965	A fantastic example of solid quality workmanship .This is one vehicle I would recomend to a new car buyer .
2970	It is surprising that there are not a lot more Touring's on the road.
2971	Then again, the blame can be explained by sub-par Hyundai dealership service and reputation.

3040	I can tell you it's a very nice riding car.

3055	This review is for the 2.0T Premium.

3131	If you want a fast sports car for really cheap and at this price its unheard of - this is definitely the car.
3136	I would strongely recommend this car to anyone seeking a competitively priced sports car, if you have not driven a Hyundai you must test drive one today...why pay more ?
3137	Beautiful vehicle with a fluid design.
3142	Before purchasing a Sports Car, do yourself justice and Take a Genesis Coupe for a Test Drive to Compare Products.The Car Will Sell Itself.
3149	Trust me when you hear the loose washers on a bolt sound coming from our cars you wouldn't like it either.

3271	fun to drive and love the way it looks
3276	You can't shift the paddle shifters easily when turning the steering wheel, makes sense.
3277	The 8 speed auto transmission is wonderful, very smooth.
3278	The manual mode of the automatic will not hold a lower gear if you reach 'redline', it shifts automatically
3283	A wonderful car for a great price from a company whose goal was to out Toyota the Toyota build quality.
3284	They hit a home run with this one
3289	Strong car for the money with good looks and power under the hood.
3290	The interior is much better than he Camaro or the FR-S.

3427	Definitely recommend a test drive for anyone shopping large sedans at any price.
3433	Hyundai made significant improvements in ride, and sound deadening along with refinement on the existing amenities.
3445	They need to learn to take the car out of ECO mode and use the manual shift mode.
3452	I would do it all over again.

3553	Highly recommended for the young enthusiastic couples to buy.

3692	This cuv, in my opinion, came out ahead of the other ones I drove when looking for a new vehicle.
3693	Very happy with the 2.0, pulls better than the 5.4 V8 in my last vehicle.
3699	Test drove about 10 SUV's and this was the best choice by far!
3704	Coming from a sedan, it's going to take a bit to mold to me.
3713	On the highway I get about 28 mpg, around town
3723	Excellent vehicle.
3724	What else can you say about excellence?
3729	Sanfa Fe 2.4L is a great Suv overall its have lots of standard feature and cool blue light bluetooth is easy to use.
3730	Tailgate is easy to close when at full open.
3731	Great Suv
3741	Driving lights and a power liftgate are nice options, but they're certainly not a deal breaker for the Santa Fe.

3916	To have an SUV that can flirt with 30 MPG if you are careful is a pleasant surprise.
3932	Look elsewhere
3937	Hyundai Santa fe is a Family Crossover, sporty look, very nice design and fun to drive.
3943	I reviewed Mazda, Honda, Toyota and Ford models before settling on the Santa Fe, none of the other brands could provide the performance/quality/options for the same price.
3948	Very good value for the money.
3949	Warranty cant be beat.
3954	I would and have told friends they must drive one.
3955	Then buy one.

4015	Do not get this car if you think your going to get 35 MPG Highway because it's not going to happen, not even close.
4026	Great car for the money.
4027	Compared the Malibu, Fusion and Camry and ended up with the Sonata SE.
4038	Don't buy 2.0T...
4044	Blown away by this car!

4051	Easy to work on if you do your own maintenance like oil and filter changes.

4059	I am very impressed with Hyundai quality and performance.
4060	I plan on sticking with Hyundai since they have such a variety of styles (16 year old first car to SUV's with 3rd row seat)
4072	I wanted something that would be best on gas, and lowest on the monthly payments
4077	The dealership is excellent.
4078	Great service.
4079	Sonata has good mileage averaging 26 mpg with 50/50 hwy and city.
4080	If Hyundai can fix the road noise issue, it will be even more popular.
4085	This car is a home run.
4086	If you are in the market, you can not go wrong here.
4093	we're getting 36-37 mpg on road trips or my 69 mile commute.

4100	I had never driven a Hyundai until I test drove this vehicle.
4101	I was pleasantly surprised and was hooked.
4102	If you are looking for a stylish, reliable vehicle, with enough bells and whistles for a not so expense price, then take a look at the Hyundai Sonata
4107	An excellent car.
4108	You can't beat the price or the 100,000 mile warranty.
4113	At 69 years of age I have owned many, many cars both domestic and foreign.

4168	great car
4174	We have put about 5K miles on the car including trips and couldn't be happier with our purchase.
4179	The Sonata is at a crossroads as to where it wants to go from here.
4180	It has been floating around at near the top of its class for awhile now but, when will see the next step forward?
4181	As of right now it has a solid interior, plenty of options, sweet price,
4186	Beautiful color, sporty styling (my 18 yr old grandson loves it).

4475	It's probably better suited for a teenager.
4481	A great car, at a great price.
4482	with a great warranty.
4483	its was close between the sonata and the mazda 6 but the mazda was more with less stuff though it drove a little better it didnt warrent the extra cost and it doesnt even come to the power the sonata
4488	For the style and overall comfort you can't go wrong.
4489	I never thought Hyundai would get my vote.
4490	But I'm very pleased.
4498	So we upgraded to the bigger Sonata and have not looked back.
4503	Great car, fresh design, great gas mileage.
4504	Do something about the passenger seats and mirrors (lower it some)
4515	I love the bluetooth to play my music from my phone in my car!

4523	Sorry I made the change.
4529	Overall a great car for the price!!
4546	Nice
4557	I had a 2004 Sonata for 8 years that I just Loved.
4558	The 2013, I just like.
4573	With the price of gasoline today a car with lousy gas mileage gets downgraded badly by this problem.
4578	grat car
4583	Excellent!!!
4599	I have had the car for three weeks and have just under 3,000 miles and it has been a joy to drive.I drive 50,000 miles a year so this car is comfortable for me.
4604	definitely recommend, years ahead of the bland Accords and Camry's, fusions look good, but I bet no one gets 47mpg...
4609	Excellent automobile that offers all the bells and whistles for the average person.
4616	!I will be buying another soon (probably a 2014)
4626	The car handles well, can fend for itself on the interstate.
4628	We would purchase another.
4648	excellant
4653	Very pleased with purchase - lots of options with the Limited - classy look and fun to drive!
4658	Don't underestimate this smaller end crossover.
4659	Hands down it has more passenger room than any other vehicle in its class.
4671	Overall its a good car for someone looking to get the maximum value.
4687	Great vehicle.
4699	If there is a better buy in the small SUV market, I've yet to find it.
4701	The previous post lamented that once you trick
4707	It delivers what they advertise.
4719	I'm not the constant driver of this car (It's the wife's) so driving this from time to time is ok with me.
4725	Don't waste your time researching this car
4731	I also like the gauge cluster and dash look better on the Tucson.

4848	You cannot go wrong on this purchase..if you do your research, go drive the competitors, study ALL aspects of a vehicle in this class/style/range...or even a step up on the pricing...the winner is THIS CAR...if you're honest with yourself about it.

4854	EXCELLENT VALUE, LOW COST OF OWNERSHIP, GREAT RESALE, BEST WARRANTY, WHY WOULD YOU WANT SOMETHING ELSE IF YOU'RE A VALUE SHOPPER LIKE ME.
4860	And That is the true test of a great car.
4861	I researched probably every car on the market.
4862	Couldn't find any other car that was Sporty, took Regular Gas, Relatively Fast with the Turbo, Has Great Gas
4867	This is a zippy looking car that is fuel efficient fun to drive.
4868	More power is available in the turbo version but for evey day driving, this car is hard to beat.
4873	I would recommend this to anyone wanting a sporty, economical car, with some power - the turbo.
4875	It has better safety features than many other small cars and I actually feel safer in this
4881	I have to say that Hyundai has a great warranty.
4882	I was also impressed to find out that they are going to reimburse me about $25 for every 3000 miles because their estimated miles per gallon was off by a few gal
4887	Great fuel efficient coupe big on style and comfort.
4893	People still are impressed with its looks and love the 3rd door.
4898	Overall, I love this car and I have no regrets about choosing it.
4899	It makes me happy every time I drive it!
4904	I will own this car for many years to come...hope to drive it way over the 100,000 I put on my previous Hyundai!
4914	If you want a fast, fun, funky car this is it!
4919	I love the car just wish that the radio worked right and that it had better insulation against road noise
4930	Get the turbo!
4931	well worth it.
4932	Have a friend who bought the non turbo and now wishes he did.

4956	This is a niche car.
4958	It's a truly entertaining daily commuter with an edgy appearance and a ton of technology built in.
4969	Traded my Elantra in on my Veloster.
4971	The transmission also shifts very smooth.
4972	The car is easy to drive with handling that's very, very surprising.
4973	Plus, if you get the Style pack
4998	Love it and I'm retired
5003	Everything was great besides the style.
5004	It is hard to recommend such an ugly car.
5015	The car handles great, but sadly, the 1.6L GDi still has that lag between 1st & 2nd gear
5020	great car...I am glad not everyone has one...I like being special.

5056	Very pleased with purchase.
5061	Love this car, totally recomend it.
5066	The Veloster Turbo is head turner regardless of what color you get it in.
5067	The turbo model has definitely boosted the rep of Hyundai upstart.
5068	Overall this new model within a few years will be leading the way!!

5101	Great overall car!

5111	I wish I had waited for the Turbo for a little bit better acceleration, but overall, you will NOT be disappointed in this car (just no racing away from red lights).

5206	I would recommend this vehicle to anyone in the market for a SUV.
5211	Love it!
5216	Excellent ride combined with a ton of luxury features.
5217	My only real complaint is the poor gas mileage.
5222	See above
5227	Bought 2, I liked it so much.
5233	So many standard features compared to it's competitors.
5234	If you haven't driven one, it is worth your time.
5240	Realiability and appearance the car is perfect.
5250	Over all is a very good car and good pricing compare to other similar cars.
5255	The best of the best!
5260	Performance that matches a 335i and smokes an A5 for about $200 less per month on a lease.
5265	I'm in love with it..!!
5270	I like a car to be a little less than common place.
5271	There are so many BMW's on the road that I shy away from them.

5295	Great value for the price.

5307	The g37x is a BMW killer for much less money.
5308	The car feels like a sports car when you want to have fun and is smooth and quiet when you are just trying to get home.
5314	Great price for an entry level luxury sedan.
5315	Previous vehicle was an 2009 Acura TL, and this G37 misses some of the attention to detail stuff.
5321	This is a great 4-door sedan.
5322	I was looking for a 4 door with a heart of a sports car and this is it!
5327	Given the competitors in the class - along with those cars a step below - you can probably get a better value.
5333	The interior is luxurious, with plenty of seat adjustments to ensure a perfect fit for both the driver and the passenger.
5340	I have no doubt that I will be buying another one in a few years.
5341	You will not be disappointed if you buy this car.
5346	Love this car.
5347	Fun to drive
5353	I have a 2010 G37xS with 30K miles for over 2 years now and would buy a 2013 if this one wasn't such a great car.
5354	The stearing feel 99.9% of the 10 year old 5 series.
5355	New BMW's are a shado
5360	A good compromise, good value and performance for the money.
5370	I don't think you can get a nicer faster more equipped car for the money period.

5621	It's very fast and satisfying everytime I drove it.In term of performance, pricing and option there is just not a car that can compete with it, currently.I highly recommend you go test drive one if you haven't.
5626	Overall a great car.
5631	Infiniti has really hit a home run with the Q50.
5636	Based on looks alone this is a super car.
5637	I like the ES350 better, better ride and better Navagation center ...
5643	The system has to boot when the car starts and will spontaneously reboot occasionally while driving.
5644	This clears the navigation system and resets all the controls.
5649	The car is an Infinity....that says it all!
5655	Best car I've ever owned.
5656	Not going back to BMW, whose marketing, in my humble view, exceeds its reliability.
5661	Overall I give the Q50 a 10 !
5662	Its combination of luxury & performance is a step ( or TWO) above others in its class !

5711	Was looking to purchase a 911 Turbo but the F-Type is such a head turner.
5718	It is a small car overall, but that adds to its nimbleness.

5889	If you are thinking about purchasing a mid-size SUV, this one is well worth the investment.
5904	Great mid sized SUV.
5909	Great car.
5910	We have only had our Trailhawk for 2 weeks now but have been in thick sand, off roading on trails, and in snow.
5911	It handled them all amazingly.
5912	It is better looking in person.
5913	Photographs don't do it justice.
5919	As much as I loved the vehicle I couldn't get over the service from the salesman, he wasn't pushy or trying to seal the deal right then and there.
5920	He really catered to my needs.
5921	When I finally do decide to buy I will fly down to LA just to buy from him.
5931	Jeep outdid theirselves with this one
5936	Go and TEST DRIVE ONE TODAY!!!
5937	You will not be disappointed!!
5944	For suburbanites like me, the Limited will be just right.
5945	The Mazda CX-5 is nice, so is the Ford Escape.
5946	The 2014 Che
5959	Clearly best ride in the class
5969	Doesn't have the power of my Grand Cherokee with the V8 Hemi, but then I didn't expect it to and it sure gets better gas mileage.

5975	I RECOMMED THIS SUV TO ANYONE.
5976	I LOOKED AT CHEVY .NISSAN.
5977	NO MATCH.

5994	good basic vehicle for northern climate
6000	That cut down on having to adjust to a new ca.r Much less engine noise and it has the feel of a passinger car.
6005	I would highly recommend this vehicle.
6006	It is among the best of the best.
6012	Also if they were not ongoing I would fill better giving the vehicle a high rating.
6014	Review ID:
6019	Decent ride and capable jeep.
6020	But even for 55K it is still a jeep.
6021	Tens of thousands cheaper than Range Rover with the same options but will be in the shop as much as a Range Rover.
6022	However with the range rover you will at least have service reps pretend
6028	Restarted the car 3 times and it came back on.
6030	Had to pull over turn the car off and it came back on.
6036	One of the best cars I have owned with lots of features.
6042	The Grand Cherokee is an excellent choice, we were considering several vehicles in the same segment when we decided to go with the Grand Cherokee and I wouldn't have it any other way.
6049	Advise- read the manuals and know your build date!
6054	4k on it so far and I still really like the looks of the GC.The 8 speed tranny is nice, except at low acceleration it's a little lungy getting from 1st to 4th gear.It tows my ATV's with ease with the 5.7L Hemi; although that comes at a price at the pump.
6059	Save your money and from being very disappointed and buy something else.
6069	Its a good vehicle
6074	So far at 7,000 miles and dispite one recall for dash display, we really enjoy driving this vehicle.
6101	Overall a great deal for the money,
6107	Very unique towing capacity without going to a pick up truck and sacrificing sporty performance.
6125	The new electrontics far more than any other Grand .
6133	Dealerships with employees that know nothing about the vehicles they are supposed to be doing service on.
6134	Repeatedly blown off and treated like I was crazy.

6162	Overall it is a great vehicle and I am a Jeep lover so we will get along well.
6180	A dealer should be more informed on how to help a comsumer not familiar with a very nice equipment.

6292	Sorry they're not making them anymore.
6294	Guess I'll look at the new Cherokee next.
6299	Put a good set of tires on it and you're ready to roll!
6315	I drove it about 10 times and I just don't like it.
6316	My friend does though so hey at least hes happy.
6321	I rented one of these for a week in Hawaii, and I wanted to share my experience.All vehicles are tradeoffs - you trade weight for space, or gas mileage for performance.
6340	Drive before you buy.
6345	Overall I like it
6350	I like the fact it's built in Ohio with a great deal of domestic content and American labor.
6362	After reading auto magazines reviews, I almost did not consider test driving this vehicle.
6377	Heated leather seats, navigation, satellite
6388	It is priced right.
6390	PLENTY of leg room for all passengers.
6392	Amazing stereo.

6416	Would give a 10 out of 10!
6422	I wanted a manual transmission and Toyota doesn't offer one in the RAV4.
6428	For the money, this is a great buy.
6429	If you want fancy, them this might not be for you.
6430	Colors are limited, but good.
6431	Not a van and not a car, but a very good choice for something in between.
6436	Great vehicle.

6511	It is a Jeep!!!
6532	My next car won't be a Jeep
6543	It is the most vehicle for the money if you need all wheel drive.
6559	Not worth it
6566	The 4WD in Jeep's are in a category by themselves.
6567	No other vehicle can do it better.
6574	Reccomend it to anyone!
6590	I love it!
6596	Fantastic vehicle!
6609	It's a Jeep!
6620	It is a must have.
6627	I have even learned to do the Jeep wave!
6632	To summ it all up..
6633	Aggressively styled, luxuriously appointed, appropriately powered and generously priced.
6634	There really is no competition to this Cadenza, it has set the benchmark for affordable luxury for the working class.
6635	Like me.
6640	2014 Kia Cadenza has entered the scene and is starting to build its reputation with a bang.
6641	Having captured a first and second place victory in recent comparison test versus the competition, this new Kia is on its way.
6642	Exterior of new Cadenza will remind
6647	Great car for the money- and I drove at all of the competition.
6648	None could compare.
6653	Perfect car for my family
6658	Test drove one of these while I was waiting for my parents Maxima to be serviced.
6659	It needs work badly.
6660	Its horribly underpowered, the transmission is indecisive and very slow to shift.
6661	It will not downshift unless you put the pedal to the floor.

6773	The Cadenza fits the bill.
6780	The Cadenza fits the bill.
6790	If you test this car you will buy it.
6798	It is worth taking a test drive to experience a car that is a better value with all of the features it offers than the competition.
6808	luxury at a managable price, with all the luxo items u would find in a higher priced car.
6810	I highly recommend this car for at least a test drive it will sell itself.
6815	Good value with the best warranty on the msrket.
6836	This car handles very well.
6837	Gas mileage is awesome
6843	The outside body design is sharp distinctive styling, particularly its tail lamps,running lights, and HID headlights.
6845	Interior styling with its soft-touch dashboa
6860	This is a nice car, however you might want to look for something more economical if most of your driving is in the city.
6867	Between the Sorrento, the Soul and this Forte I have become a real KIA fan.
6883	This 2014 KIA FORTE EX is one of the Best cars i test drove and you get your moneys worth!

6926	love it!!!!
6931	Over all this is a remarkably good looking car with more than moderate performance FOR THE MONEY.
6932	Any improvements would cost an additional 10 to 15 g. The driving feel of the car and the fit and finish make it a winner.Plus it has a five year 100,000 k
6937	great value for the price
6943	It comes with a Fix-a-flat can which is only useful in certain situations.

7225	Very capable vehicle.

7227	For the deals you can get on an LR2, it not only undercuts the X3, Q5, GLK, and XC60 by thousands, but even beats a loaded Tiguan, Escape, etc.

7255	OUTSTANDING!!!
7260	If you don't have the new Range Rover get one now.
7265	Great for 1-2 person commute.
7266	Fun drive.
7273	This vehicle is not worth the risk.
7279	Land Rover took a big risk in America on this compact SUV, they needed a better fuel economy asset vehicle to stay competitive and relevant in the market place.
7286	Looking forward to a long trip this fall.
7296	This SUV rides like a dream on the road, great power and acceleration.
7309	It is powerful, comfortable, luxurious, and stylish.
7321	I recommend test driving the Sport model but, if you are looking for more of a soft ride vehicle try the Range Rover HSE, non sport model.
7322	This is also a great vehicle also.
7332	Yes, this car is more expensive.

7367	Will be going back in 2 days to try and make a deal.
7372	A Best Buy by any measurement.
7377	I highly recommend this car if you are interested in a sporty looking, great driving, gas saving vehicle.
7379	However, you must keep in mind, the motor and electric motor is exactly the same of a Prius.

7385	If you don't consider this car you are making a big mistake
7395	wow
7401	The car is well-appointed with many of the features you find in a similarly priced luxury vehicle.
7425	I'd recommend to anybody looking at equivalent models such as Cadillac CTS, BMW 3 or 5 series, Mercedes 200 or 300 series, don't waste your money the Lexus ES 300 h is better, less expensive, far better on gas and truly an attractive body style.
7426	Review I
7431	The single most important feature in this car is the sport mode.
7432	It would be hard to merge into highway with 4 cylinder 156 HP limousine size car.
7433	Sport mode is a must to merge into highway from a low speed.
7439	Luxurious, quiet, smooth ride.
7440	Great appointments inside the cabin.
7441	I love the way it looks on the street.
7443	Roomy front and back.
7459	Excellent quality, great luxury, good performance and outstanding mileage for a car of this size.
7480	If you like a quiet comfortable ride with some sportiness, this is the car for you.
7486	If you're looking for comfort and quality for the money, this is definitely the car for you.
7499	Although the Avalon and ES 350 share numerous systems, the overall driving experience in the ES 350 is well worth the extra $3K to $4K.
7506	Premium required in most luxury cars.
7512	Great car.
7517	Excellent car.
7518	I never thought they could improve on the ones I owned previously but they sure did.
7519	I can't imagine a better car than this at any price.
7524	Absolutely stunning value for money.
7525	Please, before bashing Lexus for just being and upscale Toyota, go drive one objectively.
7526	If creature comfort, long term reliability and family are your focus, this will be your top 3 consideration.
7527	Yes, I have driven
7537	Great car!!!
7542	just a very nice sedan
7552	WILL BE GETTING ETH CAR IN 2-3 DAYS AND VERY EXCITED

7632	Acceleration is brisk with a little engine sound thrown in.
7637	For a person that loves an excellent vehicle with performance & handling !
7647	best car ever
7652	In the less than 100k bracket this Lexus 350 is an all around practical (but cool) car.
7657	I want to love it, but the problems I've had with the luxury features are very frustrating!
7663	I was loaned a Porsche Panamera for a week, and loved it, in many ways the GS F Sport is comparable, with more room in the rear seats.

7945	Overall, I love the car, it's every bit a Lexus with a kick of sport.
7953	I think it looks great and is fun to drive.
7954	I can see why they say it is better then the BMW 335.
7960	I test drove the new BMW 3 Series and Mercedes C Class, but liked the Lexus much more.
7967	makes the drive in the inner city rush hour a whole lot easier to deal with
7973	Instead, I would spend the extra money and go for the IS 350.
7985	Excellent choice for drivers wanting a great handling car and a reputation for quality and reliability.
7990	Just saw online
7995	overall its reliable, fast, stylish and comfy but it a little to expsensive
8011	Its a bit pricey but hopefully the price lowers a bit so this great car can be driven by more consumers.

8081	pricey but nice.

8344	We tested six SUVs in this size/price range and found a lot to like -- and some to dislike -- about each.
8346	Mercedes felt solid but was too small.
8347	Cadillac had power but the cabin felt cheap and plastic-y.

8353	I am only writing this because I just read so many reviews about how SMOOTH it is.
8355	It's not bad but definitely not a passenger car or like 2009 RX.

8455	I think this is a great car if you're in the market for a BIG hauler.

8497	This car puts Lexus and others to shame, especially considering the really poor recent Lexus crash tests from the insurance institute.

8649	Excellent car for the price!
8654	I don't pay any attention to what Consumer Reports says about cars.
8656	This car is a true luxury car and is very safe.
8661	Everyone should give this new Lincoln a try lots of standard equipment for the money .American luxury is back.

8711	Many people are saying they like the car.
8712	L
8717	Lincoln(Ford) are making excellent cars.
8718	I am so surprised that their ratings by a so-called experts are not higher.
8724	It handles as though it is on a rail, there is literally no body roll when cornering, it stops sure and straight.
8725	It is comfortable and has incredible curb appeal.
8726	It is fairly fuel efficient and still allows you the s

8787	Would recommend
8792	Top notch,test drove the RX,MDX and Grand Cherokee.Nothing compared!
8807	Many of the problems were created by Ford/Lincoln with the Touch system.
8808	It had way to many bugs in it when they released it and did not have a good patch.
8813	Great American car.
8821	It has everything you need for a great driving vehicle.
8823	The MKX has plenty of power under the hood.
8825	Review
8830	Fantastic SUV.
8831	LIncoln has outdone itself.
8837	The salesman did a good job of going over all of the options, but it's a lot to remember.
8853	Love this vehicle !!!
8854	all the comforts that a vehicle should have beutiful interior gorguos leather seat's and trim exquisitly done with perfection
8860	More features come standard with this vehicle than most.
8882	Test drove Buick enclave and the Cadillac crossover and this car beat both cars.
8888	i am seing a lot of them out on the roads these days.
8893	What a vehicle class class class!!!
8904	Overall the lincoln mkx is a true American luxury car that looks more expensive then it is.
8905	Highly recommend the mkx to anyone looking for a true luxury car with out the luxury price.

8960	Last ditched attempt at a failing car company.
8961	Lincoln Mercury .
8962	Truly your fathers luxury vehicle
8967	Beautiful car from design to execution.
8968	The paint is a mile deep (Ingot Silver) and the leather on the seats is buttery soft.
8969	The handling is excellent, and the power from the 2.0 Ecoboast is more than enough for any situation.
8993	2013 MKZ is something Lincoln can really be proud of.
8994	The overall concept of the design from head to toe was risky but, well worth the return.
8995	Starting with the powertrain, V6 pumping out 300 horses felt strong and agile.
9002	If you test drive the MKZ after test driving other hybrids, I think you'll agree.
9008	Most review comparisons that include the Lexus 350, Mercedes Benz 300+, Avalon, Audi 6, BMW 5 series and especailly the 2015 Cadillac CTS don't include this car.
9009	The revi
9014	Ford deserves a lot of credit for bringing this car to market and then refining it and pricing it to be competitive.
9023	It is much nicer than the BMW, CTS, Audi or Infinity.
9025	I almost purchased the CTS but the MKZ was mo
9030	The low profile 19's with the painted pocket rims in the Ice Storm blue color is a head turner.
9031	Everyone thinks the car costs 15-20 grand more than it did.
9043	In my opinion the best hybrid on the market.

9077	The MK
9082	Why isn't everybody driving a Lincoln forcing the price down for all of us.
9087	It is not the Lincoln Town Car, it is smaller and has less enterior room.
9094	Great car!
9112	It does take some time to learn how to efficiently drive and get the most out of your mileage.
9119	No price hike for hybrid key to original purchase.
9130	My American made car: awesome !!
9135	This car is definitely worth putting your review list!
9141	Price for the standard features is unmatched across the luxury market; comparing like vehicles.
9154	Excellent
9175	Overall love the Lincoln MKZ Hybrid.
9176	A few tweaks could be done with regard to storage compartments, gas mileage, etc.
9178	Previously owned a 2011 Fusion (which I loved) but wanted

9278	Rare.
9283	AWESOME.
9284	For the price (93,000) you can't beat it.
9285	Experts are comparing this to cars well over twice the price.
9290	I don't know who wrote the other review, but almost sure he does not own a Lotus.
9291	Not sure why he wasted his time even putting up a review
9296	Your thinking mactehs mine - great minds think alike!

9429	Look no further... My sister is buying one this weekend.
9435	HIGHLY RECOMMEND
9440	A Rav4 does not come close to this car!
9442	The CX-5 with the 2.5 really does drive like a sports car.
9448	2013 CX-5 will be less expensive but getting the 2.5 2014 is well worth the extra cost.
9449	I don't believe anything else changed between the 2013 and 2014 SUVs.
9459	This is hands down the most affordable and fuel-efficcient SUV/Crossover that is available on the market.
9461	Mazda is one of the top manufacturers in the biz today.

9477	Never have been a big fan of Mazda but like this car!
9483	I am not disappointed.
9484	This grand touring model with all its features was materially less expensive
9490	Better than the Honda CRV, better than the Toyota RAV4, in every aspect.
9499	The 2014 is the same car with minor upgrades.

9505	I became interested in the CX5 after extensive internet surfing, reading reviews and ultimately traveling over 150 miles to test drive one.

9542	Great SUV
9553	I think driving should be fun, but I need a practical vehicle that can hold some cargo.
9559	Nice looking SUV with good gas mileage, but they should improve the back seat access by moving back the wheel wells to allow adults to get in and out better.
9561	Mazda seems to be cutting back on th
9571	Great driving car with the best looks in any SUV I have seen.
9579	Perfect for what we need.
9585	With the new 2.5 liter engine this vehicle feels alive, agile and downright sporty.
9587	The interior is capacious and well suited for families.
9588	If you care about driving at all, this is the only vehicle you'l
9593	The car has issues behind.
9594	If Mazda can solve it, it is OK because bugs/flaws are reasonable for a first year model.
9595	But if Mazda could not solve it or does not have the right attitude to solve issues, it becomes a real problem.
9606	They do make fun, reliable cars.
9613	I like the fact that you don't see a lot of these on the road.
9614	Glad I waited for 2014 2.5 engine,.
9619	Big upgrade over the CRV this year.
9624	A very impressive small SUV
9629	Great value and very stylish!

9650	I have been averaging just under 30 mph in mixed driving.
9655	Attractive exterior design, very good grip and steering.
9656	Great MPG.
9664	An outstanding new addition to the SUV market.
9670	The SUV handles very well.
9671	It drives like a race car making sharp turns easy and effortless.
9672	The SUV can accelerate pretty well and it is responsive to my maneuvers.
9683	Quieter and better handling than others I drove.
9689	The perfect match for economy and power.

9791	I am obsessed with it!!!!
9801	My search for the right vehicle was long.
9808	It's little but has tons of   zoom-zoom.
9819	If you want a 5-passenger SUV that offers great looks, playful driving manners, impressive technology and good value, the 2014 Mazda CX-5 deserves a test-drive.
9820	That it boasts class-leading fuel economy of up to 35 mpg feels like icing on an already tast
9825	Great car, great on gas, more fun to drive than any other SUV I have ever driven.
9837	If your going for the GT pay the extra for the tech package.
9853	I love it!
9863	If you are looking for a small to mid-size CUV then this is the vehicle for you.
9881	I would highly recommend this Mazda vehicle.
9893	They are so fun to drive!
9908	Excellent vehicle for the cost concious.
9914	overall typical great Mazda quality
9929	Great design and have no maintenance issues ever!
9934	Final assessment: we did a lot of research between this vehicle and the GMC and Chevy equivalents and based our purchase on the reviews that consumer reports gave this car.
9936	Still, for the amoun
9950	The ideas can be incorporated into next year's design.
9961	First one was a 2008 which was bullet proof.
9962	This one is even better.

9984	Fantastic.
9995	the best overall value in this minuscule category of almost a real car
10005	Most fun small car that should last and is cheap to buy and run.
10010	Mazda attitude about fixing this car is the worst.

10013	They tell me I have t
10019	They won't give me a ride home if I leave the car with them because I live more than 10 miles from their dealership.
10020	The will not lend me a loaner car to use while they have my car.
10043	This is a fun, sporty car.
10044	It is great on gas and is fun to drive.
10055	I am used to driving luxury cars.
10056	The Mazda 3 G.T.S.
10057	compares favorably to any of them and at a dramattcally lower price.
10068	I did a lot of research online in regards to price (including the competition), and I found out quickly that Mazda's don't carry a lot of mark-ups and rebates!
10080	I feel that Mazda has but its best foot forward on this car.
10081	I did not drive the Mazda 3 with the less horsepower, so I can only say that the 184 hp is more than

10091	Great value as I compared other cars in the segment.
10112	It has come back and it is on a mission.
10113	From the smiling grill to the new design language of the Mazda brand has definitely turned the 3 into a smooth and attractive option.
10119	Excellent Car

10153	One web site review satated this is the most outrageously fun vehicle to drive.
10159	There are not many ways to shape a mini-van  box , but I feel the M5 is stylish, aerodynamic, and I like it.
10164	The Mazda6 is an awesome attractively priced mid-sized car for people who like to drive.
10165	Styling is jag-like, interior is almost Germanic in functionality, and the new Skyactiv engine and drivetrain has been delivering 28 mpg in the city consistently.
10166	I
10176	2014 Mazda 6 really stands out amongst its peers.
10177	With new designs of the Fusion, Altima, and Accord the Mazda had to bring something out to attract car buyers.
10178	Exterior and interior on the 6 is definitely sharp and it will get your neighbors attention.
10189	Loads of tech available if you want it, plenty of standard features for the more value minded.
10190	And 38mpg!
10191	Mazda has a winner with this one.
10201	After test-driving the competition from Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Ford and Kia, this is hands down the best midsize sedan on the market right now.
10208	MPG, great styling, comfort features and fun to drive, all at a reasonable cost, were the priority features I was searching for.
10214	I obsess.
10215	A lot.
10216	My initial short list was Civic, Accord, Mazda3 and 6, and the CX-5.
10217	I dropped Civic and 3 w/out even looking, thinking why go small when small family is growing?
10218	So we're down to three cars.
10219	Dropped Accord because, well, they're somewha
10224	I REALLY wanted to love this car.
10225	I wanted to get one as soon as I saw the new design.
10248	Darn right especially with a diesel!!!
10254	It's just about perfect for a family sedan.
10260	IIHS top safetypick, zoom-zoom, great mpg, great looks...I guess it is the full package.
10261	I really think it is an excellent value for the $$
10266	I fell in love with this car off of the looks alone, I never test drove I only sat in the car at a local dealer.
10268	I had the car delivered to me being the b
10274	Do a google.
10275	Enough said.
10281	Lots of technology options for your money and overall a great looking car- that looks, drives and feels like a much more expensive unit.
10286	Would highly recommend it is sporty and a great price in comparison to other cars in this class.
10292	Easily in the top tier of all current mid sized vehicles.
10298	The only cars that I drove and liked more were the Hyundai Sonata and Honda Accord.
10303	One of the best new cars on the market.
10309	Every detail in the car , starting from the Engine , I-loop technology and the sensors to the styling inside and out is very well thought of , and you could easily feel that.
10315	Great car.
10321	Excellent car.
10329	It handles both surfaces equally well.
10331	Everyt
10336	Was getting 32 mpg on the highway and now we're getting 32 mpg with the K&N in town.
10342	Handling is crisp and tight.
10343	Steering has a bit more assist than needed compared to previous Mazda 6 models, but still
10351	it's wonderful A lot of people love the color and style .
10356	love it, love it , love it
10361	I was in the market for a family car.
10363	It came down to this and Honda Accord.
10364	I am sad to say I went with Honda as this is definitely better looking, but the Cons became the deal breaker.
10365	Don't get me wron
10372	Understated luxury that is classy.
10379	Its voluptuous curves, cavernous interior, and above grade fit and finish, lets it stand out in a crowded field of Full Size Sedans.
10380	The competition from the Ford Fusion, Honda Accord, Toyota Cam
10385	Highly recommended.
10386	It rides better than the accord/altima with junky CVT.
10392	One of my top 5 picks to buy
10402	Excellent car for the money good quality feels solid.
10408	Did i say the gas mileage is awesome?
10428	Anybody looking for a Mid-sized car would be making a big mistake by not looking at this car.
10429	It is simply far and away above the Camry, Accord, Sonata, Optima, Altima and Fusion.
10435	It's a great car and I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new car.
10440	An excellent looking and fun to drive sedan.
10441	Mazda's redesign of the 6 is simply stunning, and the value delivered both in fuel economy and in safety features is really compelling.
10446	My reommendation is to test drive it.
10447	Once you do you will end up buying it.
10453	The 2.5 gas is more than sufficient for any type of driving unless you are like me and
10464	The 2014 Mazda 6 is the clear choice for those looking for an overall nice vehicle which is fun to drive.
10465	It has many technological advances with luxury sedan safety features.
10466	Young or old, you'll love the new Mazda 6.
10471	Best new Mazda in years!
10476	Do your self a favor and at least test drive the Mazda 6, before you decide to buy any other car.
10494	Why?
10495	for starters it costs less and it gives really good gas mileage for a midsize sedan.
10496	Although I fe
10511	Thanks to Mazda for offering fun to drive, solid handling cars with tons of value.
10512	Mazdaspeed 3 rules!
10528	Out of all the cars out there this one just did not work for me.
10529	If i just wanted a DD it still would not be the speed3 and as far as performance its useless.
10539	According to experts out there, this car is a race car, so not for the beginner.
10552	this car punches way out of it's price range and should not be sold or loaned to anyone under 25 with out close adult supervision.
10567	Mazda MX-5 Miata was named to Car and Driver Magazine's 10 Best Car list for 2013.

10577	The Club model rocks!
10578	The styling is awesome.
10584	OKS
10589	Amazing Sports Car!
10594	If you're in the market for a sports car, you seriously cannot go wrong with a Miata.
10595	No, it's not as fast as a Porsche, but it is way cheaper to maintain and frankly unless you're taking it on the track every day the power is certainly above average con
10605	great car for the price,it is right up there with the BMW
10610	This is a true sports car.
10611	It handles, accelerates and feels great.
10617	There are plenty of cars that can go faster in a straight line., but nothing under $50,000 that can make you smile like this car.
10628	perfect
10633	Unfortunately Mazda has stopped production of the Rx-8, but the heart and soul lives on with their final revision known as the Spirit R. I commend and respect a company that continuously innovates and truly believes in their product.

10798	For the high sticker price you are wasting your money.
10799	The sale job of prestige is not there as most consider you foolish for spending that much on an average performing ride.

10876	For me, this is a perfect all-purpose vehicle, just the right size and easy to parallel park.
10877	Basically, it's a modern version of a station wagon with all wheel drive.

11022	The SL550 is the car of choice and being a  base modelin a line-up never felt so good.

11146	The rental car made you feel like you were setting in the bottom
11151	Love this car.
11162	Worst%20car%20EVER!!!!!
11167	Mini is overrated although the S version has the power the nonturbo lacks.
11168	Base model lacks too many features that should be std.
11174	We rented a car to pickup the  MINI , so we did not have to drive two cars home.
11175	The rental car made you feel like you were setting in the bottom
11180	A perfect car for a two person household, especially if you have a larger vehicle in addition for those times when you need one.
11191	I would also recommend this car to mature drivers.
11196	Fun Car..... what driving should be!

11224	already stated
11229	Overall it is a great vehicle for a single person looking to take short to moderate trips around town or a few towns over.
11236	110k on this one so far and only on the second small repair.
11242	It's good if you don't mind spending a lot of money on it, if you want to stick to a budget, DON'T BUY THIS CAR.
11247	If you're a normal person, this car is somewhat sporty and great all around.
11248	If you're a competitive driver, be ready to have $20k - $25k to shell out.
11263	If you have fallen in love with the look of this car and must have it them that's great, go for it.
11264	it's a great looking car.
11265	But if your on the fence the numbers for this car are not as good as the camaro or mustang.

11306	Nice comfortable, quality SUV.
11307	No complaints.
11312	Its too bad that 2012 is going to be Galant's last year... Its kind of simple, but for sure a great dependable family vehicle.
11317	I have Navigation, Heated seats, and a power moonroof.
11318	Premium alloy wheels and a Sport tronic shifter, 6 disc Rockford Fosgate sound system with Satilite radio and a huge trunk!!!
11324	its an ok car to have, just hard for three carseats to fit
11329	Consumer reports tests are based upon older models.
11330	The 2012 is a contender.Although the styling is not in your face like Hyundai, it is easy to get in and out of both front and rear seats without bending your neck.
11336	Camrys, Accords 1 yr old are thousands more.

11384	You can't beat it for economy of use.
11389	Great car
11399	Doesn't make economic logic as break even is about 12 years of ownership...then you need to buy a battery that I heard costs over $10,0000.

11453	It was down to the Santa Fe, Rogue (2014) or Outlander.
11454	I am both a Nissan and a Mitsu person.
11455	But I felt the Rogue was too plush for an SUV - plus, it was priced higher with the 3rd row not being standard.
11467	The quality and value are miles ahead of the bigger car companies, and they back it up with a great warranty.

11546	The visual appearance (lines) of this car are amazing.
11547	Certain cars, Jag XK, Audi 5, look great parked; the redesigned Boxster is now in this category.

11556	For the price it really should have these two options.
11561	A great car for those who enjoy driving.
11562	Dynamite styling, excellent build quality, and all the performance you need for driving within legal limits, even with the base version.
11563	Several annoying features need correcting in the next iteration.

11637	A best buy,Ram trucks are real trucks, coil spring rear suspension and hemi engine are hard to beat.
11642	I would only buy one if I couldn't afford the F-150.
11643	I still think it is nicer on the exterior than the chevy.
11644	The interior doesn't even compare to the Fords styling.
11646	In these cases I would go with Ford or Chevy first just s
11656	This is the best.

11870	Wind does not seem to affect it greatly.
11871	It is great for commuting or us
11876	Bear in mind that the later production Big Horns were trucks intended for commercial use, fleets and so.
11877	So they are very basic; no luxuries at all and that's why they are cheaper than the average Tacoma.

12772	It isn't exactly fair to compare this vehicle with ICE or hybrid vehicles.
12773	It is in a class by itself.
12775	Even then, we are so ingrained in the way we think about interacting with
12781	In the future all cars will be like this.
12782	There is obviously a reason why Consumer Reports gave it the highest rating
12787	I truly believe this car has taken things to another level and will go down in history (with Elon Musk alongside) as one of the most influential innovations/innovators of our time
12792	The best car ever built worldwide by a longshot.
12793	Ever!
12794	Think about it.
12795	If you have a solar cell carport and a Tesla Model S. You can charge your car unlimitedly for free!
12796	General Electric GE makes Solar carports that can charge 6 electric cars simultaneo
12801	The future is here.
12812	I want i want one I want one I want Oh Santa please bring me one
12818	Before my test drive another person showed up in a $150K car and even he was wowed by the performance.
12819	For local use this would be a great car.
12820	Tesla can do a better job of sharing addit
12825	We agree this car is destined to become a classic; it's truly groundbreaking yet achingly simple and precise in concept, design and implementation.
12826	This is what American ingenuity is about.
12827	We applaud Elon Musk's vision and tenacity...though surely his d
12832	see pros and cons
12837	This car may not be foreveryone, but neither is a 911, corvette or panamera.
12838	as for range anxiety, 95% plus of people dont drive a 100 miles in a day, and rarely does anyone take their porsche 911 or corvette on a family trip of greater than 300 miles.
12839	R
12845	This car only looks like an internal combustion car.
12851	Excellent car!
12873	I drove Audi A8, Audi A6, E 350, S , 7 series, Lexus LS, etc.
12874	Tesla is a good car.
12876	But for the price, I will get the A8 Mercedes S or BMW 7 series.
12877	On the other hand, if you feel burdened a
12882	Gg
12892	Awesome vehicle, you must to appreciate what the buzz is all about
12898	I wouldnt buy it.
12899	Not unless it was at least half of the advertised price.
12900	There is more bang for your buck luxury wise spening your 60k+ on a another brand and a gas motor with good milage.
12912	This car is a masterpiece; a treat to drive, and a dream to own I'm sure.
12913	I'm trying to convince my fiance that this should be our next car.
12914	:)
12920	How can an average family, or person afford it????
12922	Sell more.Lots more!!
12932	It's an amazing piece of machinery.
12934	I think Tesla should partner up with a hydrogen fuel cell complany to produce the electricity needed to charge the battery.
12935	By doi
12945	I think this is a good car but it might need a new generation.
12950	VERY POUR FOR SO EXPENSIVE CAR
12955	Run, don't walk to your nearest Subaru dealer - they're only bringing 5,000 into the US the first year.
12960	this is a pretty good car to buy
12965	as former owner of a lotus elise, porsche boxster s, bmw 3 series, lexus is.
12966	I can honestly say, this car handles better !
12971	Go with the LTD model in a 6MT and see how driving can be fun again.
12972	Hard to find the 6MT in the Pacific NW.
12979	Run, don't walk to your nearest Subaru dealer - they're only bringing 5,000 into the US the first year.
12984	Great car for going through a mountain road.
12990	My local dealer offered me an INCREDIBLE, mind boggling deal to trade my Genesis Coupe for the BRZ and as much as I wanted the BRZ and that deal I passed it up because of the poor quality of the interior and
12995	Looking forward to Spring and summer you better believe.
12996	Bring on those old country roads.
13001	Simply a suburb modern lightweight sports car.
13002	It's a Japanese Lotus They got it just right.
13013	a true sports car
13018	Absolutely great sports car with a good price and good amenities.
13028	Zhas exceeded my expectations in all areas of performance, handling and style.
13029	Her appearance is that of a higher priced vehicle.
13052	Worth taking car of.
13063	great looking car at a not so great price when you should have recieved the ultimate machine from subaru,just like mitsu and thier eclipse ,both companies missed the mark of what we want as tuners/sport car drivers.imho
13068	With couple of options the price reach 30k.
13069	Many options available at 30-35k (Such as STI, EVO, Nissan Z).
13070	For 25-28 k I rather go for Rallliart, WRX, Base Nissan Z.
13080	Excellent vehicle for someone who appreciates driving.
13086	I sell cars, and I get to drive an exorbitant amount of vehicles in a month's time.
13088	I feel like this car has t
13098	got out with a mile-wide smile
13106	Yet to see another on the road in Denver .
13122	Great platform,howeverI am going to wait for the STI version or the 2014 WRX Or when a 4x4 version becomes available.
13127	Still a very fun car to drive which turns alot of heads.
13128	Looks more expensive than it is.
13138	Good value for the money, but a GTI or Mazda might have a bit more pep.
13139	I love the design, perhaps in a year or two they will enhance the engine.
13144	If you just want a toy, to play around with, and don't live in the snow belt, this is a good car to play with.
13146	I was crazy for buy
13151	Great driving car
13161	Subaru hit it out of the ballpark with the all new 2014 Forester!!!!!!!
13170	The info center has about 6 screens you can lo
13177	I feel the subaru delivers on the things I need: safety, visibility, and utility (including handling rough roads); my complaints are about the more subtle details of the vehicle.
13178	Re
13190	Excellent car for the money
13195	Great car and much more for your money than Rav, CRV,Outlander or Equinox (the others we considered).
13197	To top it off, Subaru also offers free break pads and wiper blade rep
13202	I hope that Subaru corrects this in the near future.
13208	I purchased by COSTCO auto program.
13209	They directed me to Grand Subaru Bensenville, IL 3.2i Limited andI got awesome price for all models.
13215	Great car!
13226	Test drove the Mazda CX5 first and compared to that model, the Subaru lags in handling and road feel.
13232	Well built, solid feel and very comfortable.
13233	Aside from the defrost issue it's an excellent value.
13239	We also think the Forestershould be made here in the U.S. like the Outback.
13246	But hate that speedometer.
13251	The turbo version drives very smoothly and quietly, with only a touch of hesitation.
13253	Appearance is a wash - the 2014 looks bloated with an aggre
13259	The View around the vehicle is good , no blind spots.
13260	Sunroof is huge.
13261	Legroom front and rear
13267	I was deciding between the RAV 4, CRV, and forester.
13269	The Rav 4 and CRV in front wheel drive costed more than the All wheel drive forester.
13279	Great Performance and Safety Record
13289	I really wanted to like this vehicle besides it's unnecessarily conservative looks.
13292	It is
13297	Well put together.
13298	The total package.
13310	were included in the price since it is supposedly an SUV ), but other than that I think Subaru did a good job.
13320	2010 forester was better but had oil co
13325	I think the forester is a great vehicle.
13326	I just can't buy one at this time as I would feel a little embarrassed driving it.
13328	Inside is roomy but they made front seats smaller (annoying).
13329	Who doesn't offer
13335	There is no other manufacturer that can deliver a unbeatable AWD system and almost 9 of ground clearance for $20,000.
13351	The MSN website has minimal information to work with and much what is here is wrong.
13352	You have drive the Forester to appreciate it.
13353	It is a far better buy than the Outback because the Outback is selling too well for dealers to price it more fairly.
13354	All Su
13359	I looked at 3 other competitors which I had researched & all would have been excellent choices.
13365	Run, don't walk to get one!
13370	I owned two RAV4's prior to this 2014 forester.
13371	they were both garbage in comparison.this forester is the best thing under $30,000I tested the RAV4, Escape, CRV, and reviewed the others, they were pathetic in comparison.check out some of the comparison v
13381	Great
13386	We have not bought a new car in years and researched alot and drove alot of suv's.
13388	It won Suv of the Year in a Car magazine!!!
13393	overrated will not let you state your opinion .
13398	This vehicle is hard to beat for it's price.
13399	This is another reason why Subaru sales are soaring.
13404	great SUV
13419	A great little car that feels bigger than it is, excellent fuel economy and handling.
13425	I absolutely love this car in the Hatchback.
13438	Love it!
13446	So, it is safe AND economical.
13447	An
13452	Great deal all around, I looked at vw tdi wagons and their premium price tag was not worth the extra 2 mpg's
13457	Great Car
13462	Excellent car, although acceleration is slow handling and breaking is very good.
13463	I get about 32 mpg combined, which is excellent for an AWD car.
13464	The car looks good and is very simple, which is good for reliability.
13465	It will get you where you need to go in
13471	Not too many of those from which to choose, but the impreza suits my needs perfectly.
13477	Im used to high perfomance 200+ HP but this is the first time ive actually been impressed with the Impreza.
13495	Very good small car.
13505	Road noise level much reduced with tire change out.
13513	I average around 30 mpg in the city.
13514	Simple and reliable.
13515	Comfortable and spacious for passengers with excellent cargo versatil
13520	I had this car for couple days when my 09 Impreza sedan was in for service.
13522	I'm not a fan of hatchbacks, but after driving it
13527	Versatile performer!
13538	Great fun and you can drive it in the winter...STi and snow tires is there anything more fun?
13548	While not the perfect car its engine, AWD, and suspension more than makes up for its deficiencies.
13555	If you enjoy the driving experience while keeping practicality, this is the car for you.
13556	The 265 turbo-charged 4cyl engine will push you back in your seat (with virtually no turbo-lag), but at normal driving speeds you'll get about 25 mpg.
13557	Very comfortab
13577	Just because it's AWD you will for sure need snow tires.
13578	The tires they come with are summer tires.After adding snow tires, winter driving is way better.
13588	Good family car.
13589	What I have come to expect from Subaru.
13596	Also, it is built in Indiana by American workers (non-union I suppose .. which is a plus in my book).
13597	The engine and CVT are built in
13602	Don't wait your time
13607	9.75
13612	CVT is not perfect but easy to live with.
13613	Paddles are great!
13620	Drove for about 2000 mi on vacation and still had trouble starting smoothly - I can do better with a standard or automatic.
13625	I intend to buy one soon
13636	This is the Swiss Army knife of vehicles!
13642	This is the vehicle for you.
13643	However, if you even remotely care about driving feel, look elsewhere.
13644	Acceleration is dog slow and noisy.
13645	The CVT cau
13652	Love the new electroluminescent instrument cluster and having the temperature gauge.
13653	Miss the compass in the rear view mirrow, but the rear view camera in the r
13658	This car is an all around winner.
13659	Luxury when you need it, with the outdoor fun when you want it.
13660	She is a beautiful car, with many admirers - I am really enjoying having a look good; go anywhere; haul anything vehicle!
13667	Quick acceleration, esp.
13668	for a 4-cyl.
13674	The styling is classy, the mileage is very good, and the eyesight feature is fantastic.
13680	The quality of this car combined with its utilitarian nature is outstanding.
13682	In snow, it out performs my Jeep Wrangler.
13695	Only Lexus comes close but a difference of almost 20K!
13710	They think of everything for those of us in snow country.
13722	great value
13727	A good sturdy car that handles snow well.
13737	Great value but at performance sake.
13743	I would highly recommend going with the 3.6, so that you can get a normal transmission.
13748	Excellent transportation for the dog and me!
13759	Excellent multi-purpose vehicle.
13775	Love this car our first suv, and I only wish that I had gotten one before, but am happy with this one,
13788	It seems to get a lot of negative reviews but the motor has a lot of power, it has a very attractive interior and is built in the USA.
13789	What more can you ask for from an suv?
13797	The interior is comfortable and roomy.
13798	It is
13804	I think it has the potential to become a new Subaru flagship.
13815	This sporty crossover is a great find at this price point.
13820	Overall this is a great vehicle.
13821	I love it.
13829	Easy to handle and safe in case you have small children.
13834	A great small sized crossover with appealing looks.
13836	Typical Subaru built like a tank and should last for several hundred thousand miles.
13852	I'd recommend this car over any similar car in it's class or pit it against any luxury vehicle offering a similar set-up.
13864	Great looks, good handling, great gas mileage all of the bells and whistles.
13866	What is not to like??
13871	Buy one!
13872	:)
13877	I would recommend it to anyone
13883	Mitsubishi Outlander Sport, Mazda CX5 and even Nissan Juke a better alternative to this ca
13888	Good car, you pay for the name but resale is part of that too.
13894	I have been a Toyota nut for decades but that manufacturer has fallen into the American trap of  bigger is better .
13895	After four 4-Runners I could not take the giant size of the latest offerings.
13896	I wanted a car that was r
13904	That kind of mileage means it is no race car, but it gets down the
13909	Love this car
13927	So far this has been a fun car.
13930	It was like the roads
13940	This thing is solid, solid, solid
13945	Great car
13957	In the long-term, I feel that I will not be di
13968	Hands down better service than the Mercedes dealership trade in came from.
13970	Buying any car, no matter how costly, is a compromise.
13971	I have been through
13976	I give it an A+++++
13981	Again I feel like the XV is more meant for teenagers.
13989	I'm gonna get a lotta drivn time outa this XV Crosstrek, that's fo sho...I have to drive yr-round from LA to PTLD and havn this dependable, sure footed & all-weather vehicle to do it all in is a God-send !

14016	That's a sensible answer to a chlalengnig question
14021	A great little truck!
14036	Very capable and competent small SUV.
14047	If you want a reliable truck, that is good on gas and i would last a long time buy a Suzuki, if you want pretty go somewhere else.
14064	good car cheap price
14074	Suzuki has done an outstanding job with the Kizashi.
14087	As a car enthusiast, engineer and master automobile technician, I I have driven and/or owned almost every car imaginable.I wanted an inexpensive AWD vehicle that would get reasonable fuel economy.
14093	I know some reviews mention  it lacks horse power.Please!.....Who says 89 gasoline and a K&N air filter can't be used?
14095	I love this thin
14100	Best car you've never heard of
14117	Safe as houses and performs well.
14118	You could pay double and not have what this vehicle has.
14135	That's not like me!
14137	And to the co
14143	Just a shame nobody knows more about this car.
14149	I always smile when it is the Kizashi's turn to get me around.
14150	Since Suzuki has left the US market, any replacement vehicle I buy will be a letdown.
14155	Suzuki announced in December that it was no longer selling cars in the USA.
14167	You cannot go wrong with the Kizashi everyone say's thats a Suzuki !
14168	But now that they are pulling out of the US market.
14170	Thank You Suzuki
14175	I love this car
14180	Great car that has quality written all over it.

14286	Don't look for tons of room-it is essentially a small car with AWD.
14293	The quality, styling, and features included are more than was expected at this price.
14306	This car will do very well for what it is desighned for.
14317	Recommend this car to anyone looking for something that is sharp looking and capable.
14318	This is the same car as the Fiat Sedici in Europe.

14585	Toyota has never let us down.

14610	Braking is fast and secure, but yo
14615	This is the SUV that I have been looking for the last 3 years.
14622	Trail edition if you are serious off roader, SR5 if you are not looking to spend money, and Limited if you want it all.
14632	Real SUV
14637	A great car!
14642	I think that Toyota did a great job on the redesign, as I never considered purchasing the previous models because they were just too stodgy.
14648	Nicer than the Lexus and costs less.
14650	MPG is very impressive.
14655	The best car under 40K hands down.
14656	Plenty of space, plenty of options, interior is a huge upgrade from last years model.
14657	Please check this car out after you have driven the rest.
14663	2013 Toyota Avalon is a bold surprise from the Toyota brand.
14664	This rendering of the Avalon gets more style and sleek lines flowing through-out the design body.
14665	Wheels can be fitted from 17's to 18's and that chrome grill gives the Avalon some swagger.
14666	Usi
14671	Fast, fun , and smooth at high speeds.
14676	really good car after all
14687	I've tested & driven Buick Regal and Lacrosse, as well as Cadillac ATS (really small for my 6'1 frame), CTS, BMW & Lexus.
14688	And for my money this car beats them all.
14689	If you're hung up
14694	It is a great looking vehicle and quiet.
14704	The Avalon is an unpretentious auto, that has surprising performance characterisitics, great quality, relevant features.
14716	9.9
14728	I think this car is a great buy.
14739	This is a very nice car.
14740	It is not like the older models that are very sedate and   Buick-like  .
14741	The new body style and design are very nice.
14746	excellent
14751	nice car
14756	This is an amazing vehicle.
14757	It has every thing you could ask for, comfort,style, economy and easy of the pocket book.
14765	These items make supposedly Toyota's top of the line car not such a great driving experience
14771	Spacious well-appointed interior.
14784	I think it's a great cruz!
14786	Beautiful car!
14791	Toyota did a great job with the redesign for their flagship.
14792	I love it.
14793	Shares many parts wuth Lexus, so if you don't require the   prestige nameplate, Avalon is a better choice.
14803	I rent and drove it for 5 days and 800 miles.
14805	As mentioned above, they tried to add some fancy touch screen and A/C control.
14812	It seems priced right and I expect to see more on the raod.
14819	It
14824	I love the looks of this vehicle.

14836	Cross traffic warning, blind spot warning, dynamic radar cruise control, loads of air bags, great headlights, extremely comfortable seats, tons of room inside, a large trunk for a hybrid.
14837	And,
14842	For the same $$, buy a Cadillac!
14848	The car is plain old fun to drive.

14907	Overall a great car and worth the price.
14908	It is basically the Lexus ES 300h without the $5K extra for the badge.
14909	A professional reviewer said that the Lexus ES looks like the box the Avalon came in, since he thought the Avalon had better styling.
14910	I have b

14938	This car is as much fun as either of those.
14939	But, it uses regular gas, is much quieter and its technology makes it safer
14945	It is luxurious and well appointed.
14946	It has all the bells and whistles, at a lower price, and lower insurance than the luxury name cars.
14947	Great for the environment.
14948	I really like that it is a hybrid.
14955	I was looking for a nice-looking sedan with room enough for all to comfortably fit - this fits the bill wonderfully.
14961	Rides well and drives well.
14966	outstanding
14976	A significant improvement to the old less stylish Avalon.
14977	It takes on an appearance very similiar to higher priced Lexus, Audi and Jaguar automobiles.
14990	Liked the Prius love the Avalon.
14991	Not much difference in MPG.
14993	At 80mph I got 41MPG with the Prius and 43.4 with the Avalon.
14994	Everyday driving I go

15014	The gold-standard in where all manufacturers should be aiming in comfort, handling, room for a family, and fuel economy.
15030	I really like this car, it fit my needs quite well.
15044	Averaging 40MPG around town and up and down hills.
15045	Voice activation a plus!

15091	I wouldn't buy this car even with a $10,000 rebate.
15092	I don't care that it has the   Toyota name or not... That alone doesn't make it a good car!
15123	Led headlight are by far more exciting to look eit
15129	Best car on the road.
15130	Not too big, not too small.
15136	It also doesn't look like a Corolla.
15144	So far this is the best car i tested
15157	Great Car
15183	If you want a dependable and capable off road vehicle (make sure to have the locking differential, worth every dime), then the FJ is your best bet for the money.
15188	Excellent!
15211	2014 is the last year that this car will be in production.
15213	But got the the 2014.
15214	So i will take care and enjoy this beast everywhere.
15219	The FJ Cruiser is a wonderful vehicle for small families or the avid outdoor enthusiast.
15220	The absence of interior carpet makes for easy clean up without sacrificing style or comfort.
15228	I can go darn near anywhere.
15229	Love it.
15234	Buy one of your own.
15239	The overall styling, drive, and off-road capabilities of the FJ make it an SUV to love.
15247	Beaches - no problem.

15497	I would suggest to everybody to try out the Prius, it is real nice every week to go to the gas pump after 525 miles and only put in 9 gallons each time!!!

15503	Discounts are high if you research.
15507	The vehicle list was just over 25,000.

15585	I get over 50 miles per gallon on a regular basis.
15586	Plus it is good for the environment.
15601	Great car!
15611	Excellent.
15629	I would highly recommend this car to anyone without reservations.
15645	I love this car overall.
15654	To be honest the Prius is the only car I considered.

15687	From the store on one trip of 9 .5 miles I got 71 mpg .
15693	Excellent car for driving in the city
15705	First, the fuel economy.
15713	Better on gas, safer, more updated features.
15719	I like this car.
15721	The car takes some getting used to because of its quirks (hybrid based I think) but once you know how to drive it
15736	Great car, probably most economical option for a small car when figured with the hybrid fuel savings.
15742	Overall, you will find owners are much happier with this car than the magazines and reviewing  professionalshave graded it.
15749	Can't wait until the plug in model is available in Michigan.
15754	I give it a 10 rating.
15759	Excellent car.
15771	The Prius V accomplished both tasks.
15772	There is a lot of cargo space in the Prius V as well a
15787	Excellent vehicle!
15793	Bought one of the first Prius V produced...was anxiously waiting for it.
15806	It's surprising roomy on the inside.
15807	I've always driven SUVs and it has that sort of spacing on the inside.
15808	I have a family of 5 with a son who is 6'2.
15849	Great car in a good price range
15859	We spent a lot of time researching & test driving different models.
15860	We considered the Honda CRV, Ford Escape, and Hyundai Santa Fe.
15867	No SU (Sport Utility) here; just another  Soccer Momvehicle for the urban/suburban city slickers/masses.
15874	It rides like its on rails and I prefer the stiffness.

15882	If your looking for a cheap price below retail msrp go for the Ford Escape .

15923	Good looking exterior.
15942	You can never be wrong choosing RAV4
15948	Of the 5 we test drove we were on agreement the RAV4 was it.
15949	If you are in the market for a crossover, for some reason, put the 2013 on your compare list.
15960	This is a great vehicle.
15976	might as well take the bus than buy this car, waste of money
15987	One interesting observation is that everyone that my wife and I have met who own RAV4s have only positive things to say about them.
15993	The right car at the right price is usually hard to find.
15994	Toyota has done an amazing job with the new Rav4 and it can be loaded with all the bells and whistles that you want at a price that you can afford.
15999	Perfect for me at age 64 for traveling , shopping, flea markets, and just enjoying myself!
16004	the best small SUV on the market
16009	While this isn't my dream car ( Audi A8), this is an awesome car.
16020	Great Vehicle in its class.
16048	Lots of new features from the old Rave 4
16058	A lot of car for the value.

16164	This is a fun vehicle to drive and the gas mileage is great.

16177	If you wish a bit of sport and towing capability, sorry about that.

16190	I closely compared the Sienna, Odyssey, and Grand Caravan before purchasing.

16260	I compared the Nissan Frontier with the Tacoma when shopping for a smaller truck.
16268	But preferred the Tacoma in almost every other way.
16269	It is not a small truck, it is clearly mid-sized.
16275	Nice looking, solid truck.
16281	If you are looking for solid reliable transportation, and need to tow 5,000lbs, its tough to beat this truck.
16292	Seems like a small issue but try driving in rain conditions on a 3 hr.
16314	I highly recommend this if you want a pickup but dont need a big pickup like an F150 or any of that size pickups.
16319	Overall I consider the PreRunner a well made truck.
16325	If you are looking for a good mid-size truck with great resale value.
16331	Excellent truck.

16448	I will probably never buy anything other then a Toyota.

17238	Excellent and economical car.
17260	If they ever allow the e-ron Diesel engine to be sold in the USA will trade up to it the day it's available.
17278	The SportWagen has the best of everything.

17348	Luxurious enough and German to compete with cars that are more expensive, even the rich cousin the Audi A4/A6.
17358	If you commute or do a lot of highway driving,the TDI is the vehicle for you.
17359	If you only drive around town and put very little miles on in a year then the TDI would be overkill, stick with the gas model.
17364	The Passat has many of the luxury sedan features, space and comforts that we test drove for a fraction of the price.
