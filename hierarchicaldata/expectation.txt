137	fit and finnish is unbelievable and this thing is solid!
245	The only other one I think might be better, or perhaps just a bit bigger is the Cadilac SUV or crossover.
291	Really like this vehicle if they could just figure out what is wrong with the collision alert system.
381	I think this car is the next Aztec.
521	Too expensive for the product
552	The only thing this suv could use is a third seat.
1169	should have power liftgate
1188	Wish it had an interior trunk/hatch open latch.
1591	Do I miss my truck?
1720	So what's it going to be Hyundai?
1823	Great car for the money, we were used to spending 60 to $70K for her car.
1827	Always finding nice
1860	I am from Detroit and know what a car should be.
2082	Your view of this car will vary depending on what type of vehicle you are coming out of.
2257	Dont believe the consumer magazines.
2301	I drove a civic and it was to low to the ground, small inside and hard to get in and out of.
2357	I would like to see a lit
2559	High maintenance and not a smooth ride.
2954	I will be buying another in 2014/15.
3082	3.8 is gonna have nothing on me :0
3192	Great vehicle for the money, turns heads, and with the 3.8, direct inject, 8 speed GT edition, it will scoot....
3214	They say the HP and torque is margin
3239	Good performance for the money, but don't believe for a second that it will compete with a Mustang GT, 370Z, Camaro, or BMW M3.
3485	Test drive this vehicle before buying any other.
3988	No wonder the altima and fusion copied it !
4146	I really liked the Nissan Altima but was not impressed with the warranty and price.
4552	Lets see if Hyudai will come through on this.
4621	Am looking at buying one as a replacement for 17 year old car.
4720	If it were mine all the time I think i would have returned it ( I really hate spongy breaks)
4823	First the stereo and navigation systems stopped working.
4957	It isn't for everyone, it's no Civic or Corolla.
5195	Too expensive.
5296	I am definately going to buy another one.
5309	Not
5510	I'm not wtorhy to be in the same forum.
5567	I hope I am eventually able to figure out the touch screen without having an accident.
5712	My only concern will be its reliability due to Jagu
5942	I'm in the market for a compact SUV in the near future and this one is the clear leader.
5988	Being brand-loyal to Chrysler products and with the price offered, it was an easy choice to make.
6089	Wish leather and power seats were available on Laredo 4x4
6113	First vehicle I've come across that fits this profile.
6193	Mostly what I notice is the somewhat smaller interior.
6250	After owning a 2002 Dodge Durango for 10 years, I wanted an SUV that I would love to drive as much as the Durango.
6322	However, this seems to be a vehicle with all downsides, while offering no benefits in
6364	I gave it a test drive and I could not believe I was in the same vehicl
6669	GM, it's time to wake up and smell the coffee.
6700	Before you buy any car in this class do y
6942	When I was shopping for a car, I looked at the Kia Rio due to it being very stylish and cheap but what turned me off to it was that it doesn't even a spare tire!!!!!!!
7039	For the money?
7042	Is it a luxury vehicle?
7274	Manufacturer does not support their product.
7280	They created a beautiful car with sleek lines, that is 95% true to the prototype we saw a few
7311	If you
7342	But the rear visibility is perfectly awful.
7378	It is a nice option if you would not want a Prius.
7434	For 46k plus price of this car is not worth it
7557	WILL BE GETTING ETH CAR IN 2-3 DAYS AND VERY EXCITED
7642	Overpriced compared to other 4 door luxury sedans especially those made in the US.
7668	There are way too many operating deficiencies to suggest someone lease or purchase this car.
7679	I am actually looking forward to my next Lexus.
7746	not worth the money
7899	Outclassed by many of it's less expensive luxury competitors.
7962	Just be sure to get t
7980	Not worth the money, far nicer cars out there for this money.
8017	Not good.
8028	Buy a String Ray!
8048	This is a performance car you buy for style and the quality.
8064	I couldnt decide btw LS vs 7 series.
8214	Buy a Nissan
8251	If you want a sportier ride, l
8287	Not worth the price.
8345	Nothing profound there.
8389	Put a moon roof on it and you will have a lot more buyers, me included
8394	Good looking , but noises!High price for status symbol!
8513	Not worth the price ..
8571	I don't work for Ford or am I in the car business.
8655	They're very biased in favor of certain Asian makes even when they're not the best.
8918	I hope they fix that issue soon.
9015	I hope that the significant improvements to the Lincoln brand can resurrect it just as Buick has done.
9147	I've wanted a Lincoln for some time.
9177	; however I have a 2012 and perhaps all those matters were addressed for 2013.
9183	What ever the MPG on car in show room with few miles is likely the mpg it will agerage.
9185	Maybe replace it with the new
9190	Overall, we not gone buy lincoln MKZ until lincoln designers find a full electric engine 3.2 or greater for this carwe will keep the car for maximum of 15 years and during this period company will have lincoln dealership services and I have no idea you d
9373	terrible horrible car glad they are out of business
9403	Find away to lower the price and change BMW looks and it will be a spot on car that every one will be lineing up to buy .
9482	In looking at this class of car, I was interested in the fuel economy, the capability of the engine and the zoom-zoom factor that one expects from Mazda.
9554	The Mazda CX-5 fills the bill for the most part, except it could use at least 20 more hp,
9636	Will it be okay in the western snow?
9678	Going to get my 2014 sky blue in two weeks time, can't wait.
9802	I have a 16 year old that is 6'3and 250
9869	I am buying this car.
9909	Worthy of a test drive first before you comparison shop.
9949	I was wondering why Mazda doesn't ask its owners for feedback on how they like the vehicle.
10028	I wish it had a sunroof and leathers seats.
10069	I went and priced the competition and realized that I felt bad for the people that bought cars
10114	A fully loaded 3 probably may
10196	From a single test drive, this has jumped almost to the top of my short list of cars to potentially replace my 13 year old Acura TL.
10226	I knew I'd have to give up a V6 but must say the 4 cyl took off quite well.
10227	Drive was great but really felt claustrophobic in the thing.
10255	You name it, we test drove it - the combination of exterior and interior styling, size, handling and feature content are hard to beat
10362	Must have driven the dealers mad in my community.
10371	I am in the market for a car and this definitely is in top 3.
10800	I don't understand the so called expert reviews.
10825	Nice car....expensive.....new design a bust
10927	doesn't seem like they put the   mercedes touch mechanically in this model.
11366	seemed really low end...not like you would see in a $34 000 vehicle.
11377	If you are seeking an electric car and not worried about how it looks, this would be an option.
11452	Been shopping around.
11530	I can't wait until my Boxster is built.
11624	Chevy, the imports, and GMC are not even in the same league.It's all about Ford vs Ram now.I hate the low end torque of the Ram as bolted to a 6 spd.Ford has that nailed.But I'd put the Ram interior against anything, anything.I'd put uconnect against Any
11629	I cannot recommend the Truck of the Year.
11937	I miss the old styling.
12221	I thought I would like this much better than I do.
12248	I can not wait to buy my new Scion FR-S!!!
12423	AND MAN.....I WAS WRONG.
12483	If you accept what it is, you'll do fine.
12499	If you are thinking about a Harley, take a ride in a Smart Cabrio with the top and side rails down.
12707	I CANNOT WAIT TO GET THIS AMAZING MACHINE.
12867	I've been waiting for about 9 years, since I first heard of the company, first for them to build a family sedan -Model S- then for it to become more affordable -60K- later for the charging stations to be nationwide -coming later this year, and more in th
12872	I am looking to replace my car.
12897	Test drove it.
12919	the car is away over-priced !!!!!.
12921	Bring the price down.
12940	As much as I like the Model S, I am more looking forward to the Model X with its slightly higher field of view, and the seating capacity for my whole family and cargo.
13030	When purchasing a BRZ, even though there is a back seat, factoring in comfort it really is a  two-seater , which is great
13087	The BRZ just did not wow me at all the way I was hoping it would, and I was disappointed.
13133	diappointing price for a car lke that.
13145	There is no way, I would drive this car in winter weather, which makes this car , unusable almost 5 months out of the year.
13162	Looking to be Motor Trend SUV of the year for 2014.
13225	Was prepared to buy but I think Subaru took a step backward on seat comfort and steering feel.
13284	Great vehicle for a family - for single guy driving in city not so sure
13290	But how can you buy and drive a vehicle with substandard seats???
13316	If subaru fix the seats and the steering, it will be good for the price.
13317	Hope they have fixed the head gasket and oil consumption issues with this new design.
13327	The look is so dated, they could do so much more.
13470	I wanted a compact wagon or hatchback with all wheel drive.
13479	People now days mostly need to sprint to 40mph
13490	Now I hear the XVCrosstrek will be produced as a hybrid in 2014 which will make leaps and bounds for the Subaru name as being a fuel efficient economical automobile.
13503	I have yet to buy a new car with good tires.
13504	There are far better tires that cost less than the stockones that came with this car.
13619	Ok for the price, but not what I want.
13700	Go with the 6 cylinder for better performance,
13956	I have always loved Subarus but still find them slightly overpriced.
14037	Worthy of a try.
14088	I came across the Kizashi by accident when looking for Su
14123	ok but seriously considering a suburu or vw r
14142	Great package if you want a car that is not around every corner like a subaru/ honda/ toyota.
14300	Time will tell.
14538	Dealer told me that this 5th gen 4runner is back to it's roots of being a 4runner and no longer on the path to family CUV like previous generations, I think I agree with this statelment.
14539	I think
14584	I expect the same quality from the 4 Runner.
14806	But they failed at this point, in my opinion.
14818	Great job Toyota for working hard on the all new redesigned Avalon its just smaller for a large vehicle but saw few on the road and website its a beautiful car someone was in the market for a $40,000-$50,000 car i would talk them into buying a Avalon.
15212	Whats up with that toyota!?!
15338	Looked at many 7 seater optional v
15368	I'm expecting Toyota quality and dependability.
15373	Ok for a mid -sized SUV, needs to be restyled.
15557	My daughter told me to look at the prius.
15558	So I rented one for a weekend trip.
15606	not good for my use
15660	Outside of the great turning radius and the glitz of the instrumentation, you cannot call this car  fun to drive .
15936	I never even considered test driving a RAV4.
15937	Now Im considering buying one!
15982	Interior materials are not what I expected, and while I prefer the liftgate to the swingout door, inter
16143	If comparing to a Honda CRV see if the emergency brake foot pedal impedes your foot from resting completely on the dead pedal as it did for me.
16441	I'm think I'll buy the full loaded double cab 4x4
16505	It had not performed to full specification a single day since delivery.Me and my wife have bought this vehicle blinded by our previous expe

16606	Just think I was looking at a Cheverlot Equniox.
16864	Once you know the good AND the not so good, you will know if this is THE car for you.
16915	Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.
16993	I have a fairly long commute and need something reliable and econo
17047	If you want a faster car or a car with top of the line interior then the GTI is not for you and you my want to go and buy a luxury sport car.
17108	I don't know why would you want to spend money on Prius.
17478	I expected a higher reliability for this car.
