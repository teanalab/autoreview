2  so far this is everything i have come to expect from a truck  even in the coldest of weather  multiple days below zero   the interior fit and quality hold true the fuel mileage is better than the ford as well as the interior egromics 
3  the gmc sierra is on another level in terms of ride and interior quality the 62 liter v8 is a monster the thoughtful touches like led lights under the bed rails and in the storage bin and the remote start via cell phone feature make this truck stand a

2  would not buy again i compromised on the power hoping for the better mpg well it delivered on the lack of horsepower but came up short on epa mpg ratings i get about 20 combined mpg and have never topped 25 mpg on a complete highway trip after now
3  traded in a 2010 mazda cx 7 and like this suv better more room quietier & smoother ride better warranty
3  the 2013 gmc terrain based upon admittedly short experience has proven to be excellent it is a good value at the price--i received 0% financing and a $500 rebate

2  until i found this i thoguht i'd have to spend the day inside

3  a very good little suv my wife loves the litte truck i would to see a litte more hp gmc you did a good job onm this truck and how to use it
3  i would recommend the vehilce however i think gmc needs to add the guidelines with the rear back up camera most vehicles have this feature when they have the backup camera for the vehicle i would think this would be an added safety feature of the veh

3  this vehicle is reliable and meets all my needs do not hesitate on this suv i tested all popular models and this one won out
3  this is the second honda cr-v we have owned the awd gets around 3mpg less around town than the front wheel
3  if you are looking for value comfort safety reliability resale value and good performance then the honda cr-v deserves a serious look highly recommended
3  i droved comfortable sport cars and coupes prior to buying this crv so it is very uncomortable to sit upright however it is a quality built and reliable reasonable priced vehicle it is more suited to a smaller person as my wife
2  having issues with the tire pressure warning light it has come on 5 times it about two months back to the dealer 3 times no solution honda america will inform me when a computer fix can be done very unhappy driving with the light on review i
3  great car looking forward to getting 250000 outa this one

2  good for use around town but don't take it on a trip unless you want a back ache and ringing in your ears
1  i really like this car
2  very stylisheasy to drive
2  we were concerned that switching from our honda accord ex-v6 to the honda cr-v would cost us more to operate but we were pleasantly surprised that our cr-v actually gets better mileage than our accord
1  needs side warning lights on mirrors
3  i love driving ! the price was great the gas mileage is better than most i would recommend this suv to others and family members great job ! :
3  this is my 5th honda after 3 civics and a pilot ex-l awd i did prefer the pilot but not the 17-18 mpg i am getting 25+ mpg in the cr-v in a blend of stop-and-go and highway driving which is good for an awd vehicle haven't had a chance to really test
3  is excellent for running around town and short trips down the interstate is not a high end ride but very well equipped i am 6 foot if you are taller you might have a problem with driver leg room had the cr-v for 1 month and found no flaws yet wife's
1  ok
2  i highly recommend this suv
2  much better then my 2007
1  construction quality is very good headlights are dangerously terrible
1  look elsewhere ----
1  good car at a good price excellent !
2  excellent

1  9 out of 10
2  the ability to think like that is always a joy to behlod
3  this is my first suv and i love ! honda truly made a vehicle in its own category: it's like a jeep a truck and a van all in one the element is perfect for my active lifestyle it is easy to park and has a small turning radius the lack of carpet make
3  out of my fourth honda three civics and this element i think the element is best so far i don't have to twist my back up for access i love the design very roomy interior it will last many years as honda's do
2  it's a really great practical auto if you own you will see
1  best all around vehicle i have ever owned does everything and takes me out for sushi
3  i bought this new at the end of january 2011 a very good suv it has honda engineering very reliable it feels safe but it does have a high profileoverall a good buy they evidently last a long time as well
1  if you take a serious look at the way you drive and you find that your real needs are multi purpose functional and reliabilty then the element should be considered you can add a few creature comforts along the way as most do with their cars the cost
2  people have frequently asked me how i like my car and i probably bore them to tears extolling the virtues of the honda element i have put very little money into this car other than the normal wear and tear type things
2  spent only about $1000 in 9 years and 178000 miles since 2003
1  a great vehicle for carrying anything from a tv to dogs

2  longevity will be the best determination of what i sum up this car to be but with the warranty it shouldn't be an issue
3  hyundai has changed the game with this machine now it's time for them to change the symbol and grab the youth/midrange age market we are the furture and hyundai can be the leader in this lucrative market so what's it going to be ? bbq or mildew

3  this is my third azera from 2008 to 2010 until now a 2012 i am so impressed with this car that i bragged about it at the 2013 philly auto show also there is not enough room given here to go into detail about my satisfying experience with azera however

1  this review is to counter the ridiculously biased review of dennis in south carolina on 08/04/2012 who sounds like an angry 9 year old child - and has no clue what he is talking about

3  overall i would say hyundai is fast becoming the auto of choice based on how many i see now and the reviews the company is receiving after a couple years i'd like to revisit this review and see what i have to day then right now it's a no-brainer

2  the car has a bulletproof engine and transmission somewhat basic suspention could be a little stiffer but steering is nice and tight needs a little practice to get it to go straight this car has the capability to last a very long time you just need to

2  i am very pleased with my 2013 sonata i would recommend it to anyoneseems like several car companies are copying the body style

1  great deal on any model hyundai at the moment take a peek for !
1  great car
3  it's probably better suited for a teenager i'm not thrilled with mine at all
1  a great car at a great price with a great warranty its was close between the sonata and the mazda 6 but the mazda was more with less stuff though it drove a little better it didnt warrent the extra cost and it doesnt even come to the power the sonata
1  for the style and overall comfort you can't go wrong i never thought hyundai would get my vote but i'm very pleased
3  i would buy another hyundia again this sonata is accutally my second i had owned a '09 elantra beofre this and had no issues what so ever so we upgraded to the bigger sonata and have not looked back

2  we are a big family but we were tired of minivans we were almost ready to by an suv santa fe/crv but one drive in the 2013 sonata and we fell in love
2  not a bad car for the money but i probably would have gone with something else had i done my research
1  nice
3  overall the car rides nice but there are a few defect with my 2013 sonata lets see if hyudai will come through on this
1  i had a 2004 sonata for 8 years that i just loved the 2013 i just like
2  this car is fine for me now but i probably would purchase a smaller vehicle next time
2  love !
1  with the price of gasoline today a car with lousy gas mileage gets downgraded badly by this problem
1  grat car
1   !
2  the car is sharp -no doubt; after 7 months of ownership i still do a double take after parking and walking away the acceleration lag is annoying to me but i think i am getting used to it and if you ask my wife it has led me to better driving habbits
2  i seldom purchase the same make of car twice but  i'll make hyundai my first choice when i start looking for another car i'll probably be keeping this to pass down to one of my grandchildren
1  i have had the car for three weeks and have just under 3000 miles and it has been a joy to drivei drive 50000 miles a year so this car is comfortable for me
1  definitely recommend years ahead of the bland accords and camry's fusions look good but i bet no one gets 47mpg
3  excellent automobile that offers all the bells and whistles for the average person i've owed camry's accords and mercedes andam extremely satisfied with my new 2013 hybrid
3  this car is a pleasure to !  ! will be buying another soon probably a 2014

3  don't underestimate this smaller end crossover hands down it has more passenger room than any other vehicle in its class my 6'3friends aren't afraid to ride in my car they actually prefer ! the cargo space is a bit smaller than one would like but
2  i would not purchase another hyundai for three reasons: 1 the dealership was unfair in negotions  2 the tires were poor and wore out too soon w/no warranty and 3 it is not good on gas
3  overall its a good car for someone looking to get the maximum value it has some cons but its looks great drives even better and it will make you smile every time you drive it

2  good truck for around town great in snow great in trails not a commuter at 16mpg but its a strong heavy truck and you feel safe in it
3  wife and i love the looks comfort and amenities looked for 'american' ! i feel great that i bought an 'american' vehicle that looks cool rides well and is comfortable
1  an ok suv
3  if you like a more car like ride on the road this is not the vehicle for you you'd be better off looking at crossoversoverall i'm happy with my purchase it's exactly what i expected after much research and i'm proud to park it next to my husband's w

2  i bought it before productions discontinued !
2  we bought the jeep as a replacement for my thirteen-year-old college car we've owned it now for six months and with the exception of the roof side rails and the amount of gas we go through we are happy with our purchase
1  i drove it about 10 times and i just don't like it my friend does though so hey at least hes happy
1  i rented one of these for a week in hawaii and i wanted to share my experienceall vehicles are tradeoffs - you trade weight for space or gas mileage for performance however this seems to be a vehicle with all downsides while offering no benefits in
2  great suv amazingly capable and reminds me of previous cherokee despite poor gas mileage you won't be driving the new cherokee disappointment set out by jeep
2  great truck tough strong good control feels great while driving i recommend it for people who like the feel of a real truck but want something that's not tremendous and takes up lots of space
3  good ute but not great as a rental drive before you buy
1  overall i like it
3  i like the fact it's built in ohio with a great deal of domestic content and american labor mine has been very reliable i use synthetic fluids and follow all maintance requiremnts and i did bring the noise of a driveline clunk to the dealers attention
2  love my vehicle and if gas mileage and engine power on takeoff were improved it would be a major contender
3  after reading auto magazines reviews i almost did not consider test driving this vehicle i was talked into test driving by co-workers who also purchased and loved their patriots i gave it a test drive and i could not believe i was in the same vehicl

3  i normally drive toyotas so this was an unusual vehicle choice for me i wanted a manual transmission and toyota doesn't offer one in the rav4 it took a lot of searching to find a nicely equipped patriot with the 5 speed transmission but it was worth it
1  for the money this is a great buy if you want fancy them this might not be for you colors are limited but good not a van and not a car but a very good choice for something in between
1  great vehicle
3  my wife and i love this ! i just went over the 200k mile mark on my 2004 tacoma if toyota doesn't get real and deal a little better on the rave4 they wanted $6k more for a base model with auto trans compared to the jeep i will be buying anothe

1  to summ it all up aggressively styled luxuriously appointed appropriately powered and generously priced there really is no competition to this cadenza it has set the benchmark for affordable luxury for the working class like me
1  2014 kia cadenza has entered the scene and is starting to build its reputation with a bang having captured a first and second place victory in recent comparison test versus the competition this new kia is on its way exterior of new cadenza will remind

2  i will probably go back to the lexus ls - my old 2000 ls400 was more enjoyable to own  ride in and to driveonly 1700 miles and almost 4 months of ownership i am disappointed
1  one of the best cars i've ever driven
3  only own this for about 2 months but am very happy styling has a wow factor amongst my contemporaries in business ride is smooth and solid not too cushy but bumps are subtley muffled all systems seem to be at the top of their game no rattles or squ
2  if you can find one at a dealership buy it you will not find a better car value
3  everything about this car speaks luxury and safety with great handling and power the sound system is one of the best and i can even put pictures of the family on the screen love this car
2  if you're looking for a car that has all the options of a an expensive car but is reasonably priced buy a cadenza
3  this was a very good choice for me coming from a 1999 mitsubishi diamante i like luxury without the badge and wanted a car that i feel i can live with for many years the cadenza fits the bill
3  this was a very good choice for me coming from a 1999 mitsubishi diamante i like luxury without the badge and wanted a car that i feel i can live with for many years the cadenza fits the bill
2  excellent vehicle with the drivability of a bmw or other camparable sedans
3  if you test this car you will buy it have had it about two months and love it had previously driven infinitis and cadillacs but this is one of the best
3  love the car it is worth taking a test drive to experience a car that is a better value with all of the features it offers than the competition
2  this car puts the fun back in !
3  luxury at a managable price with all the luxo items u would find in a higher priced car warranty can not be touched by any luxo car at a much higher price i highly recommend this car for at least a test drive it will sell itself

2  i would recommend this to anyone looking at higher-end cars corolla elantra etc great car at good price with lots of luxuries
2  the car is not bad at all just a spare tire lether seats better radio thats it
1  this is a nice car however you might want to look for something more economical if most of your driving is in the city
3  i wish i had leased the higher end upgrade with electric seats i was kind of used to them with my sorrento but overall i love this car between the sorrento the soul and this forte i have become a real kia fan
2  i do not have too much to complain about
2  excellent vehicle great price great dealership check out the kia before you spend more on a different brand

1  over all this is a remarkably good looking car with more than moderate performance for the money any improvements would cost an additional 10 to 15 g the driving feel of the car and the fit and finish make it a winnerplus it has a five year 100000 k
1  great value for the price
1  when i was shopping for a car i looked at the kia rio due to it being very stylish and cheap but what turned me off to it was that it doesn't even a spare ! it comes with a fix-a-flat can which is only useful in certain situations i would nev

2  we will wait and see before we write an overall review
1  a worth buying little car
1  see my review of 2009 kia rio5 before considering purchasing 2011
3  would highly recommend the kia ! go drive a toyota sienna and a honda odyssey you will end up paying a lot more for a lot less
1  it could be a little more modern looking it looks kind of a senior citezens van
3  the kia sedona is the right fit for me and my family lots of seating easy to get in and out of and lots of storage the quiet but powerful v6 coupled with a smooth 6 speed transmission is superb great handling and cornering the sedona handles more l

2  nothing has stopped this vehicle so far it has made light of snow ice mud and country roads in all weather conditions it is equipped with all the goodies one could wish for - a list too long to detail here - and i have put my money where my mouth is

1  the single most important feature in this car is the sport mode it would be hard to merge into highway with 4 cylinder 156 hp limousine size car sport mode is a must to merge into highway from a low speed for 46k plus price of this car is not worth it
3  luxurious quiet smooth ride great appointments inside the cabin i love the way it looks on the street the standard sound system is more than adequate roomy front and back a joy to own and a great valuethe best thing isit doesn't look like a

2  didn't thiink lexus could improve further from my past vehicles but this one did
3  was about to purchase a 2013 avalon ltd but looked at es 350 and agreed to buy the same day although the avalon and es 350 share numerous systems the overall driving experience in the es 350 is well worth the extra $3k to $4k
3  this is not a car- this is a fine ! the ride is quiet and comfortable; my gas mileage seems to be better than quoted; and it takes regular unleaded vs premium required in most luxury cars i only have 1200 miles on it so i can't address me
1  great car
1  excellent car i never thought they could improve on the ones i owned previously but they sure did i can't imagine a better car than this at any price

1  many of the problems were created by ford/lincoln with the touch system it had way to many bugs in it when they released it and did not have a good patch
3  great american car hazardous navigation system very disappointed
3  the mkx is the way to go it has everything you need for a great driving vehicle the fwd gas milage is better than we thought just under 25 mpg for city driving the mkx has plenty of power under the hood the lincoln my touch works just fine review
1  fantastic suv lincoln has outdone itself

3  an amazing vehicle for a reasonable cost if you test drive the mkz after test driving other hybrids i think you'll agree

1  why isn't everybody driving a lincoln forcing the price down for all of us

2  best car we've ever owned when we replace our other car it will be with another lincoln hybrid great warrenty !

3  would do it again no price hike for hybrid key to original purchase
2  i'm quite happy we chose the american made luxury hybrid the price diffrence probably won't be recovered in gas mileage over the gas model but we feel better about doing our small part in reducing emissions and being more efficient
1  my american made car: awesome !
1  this car is definitely worth putting your review !

1  excellent
2  a excellent choice
2  i wanted it for longer road trips the 40 plus mpg and smooth ride have made mytwo 4000 miles to the east worth the purchase
2  with a fillup indicating 750 miles to empty it's great to just avoid going to the gas station
1  overall love the lincoln mkz hybrid a few tweaks could be done with regard to storage compartments gas mileage etc ; however i have a 2012 and perhaps all those matters were addressed for 2013 previously owned a 2011 fusion which i loved but wanted
3  what ever the mpg on car in show room with few miles is likely the mpg it will agerage over all not bad car hard to see to side and rear but getting used to using the mirrows and backup camera warning sinsor are a nusance maybe replace it with the new

1  highly recommend
3  a rav4 does not come close to this ! spend the extra and get the grand touring-it is well worth ! the cx-5 with the 25 really does drive like a sports car it handles almost as well as my miata did
1  2013 cx-5 will be less expensive but getting the 25 2014 is well worth the extra cost i don't believe anything else changed between the 2013 and 2014 suvs
2  great car for the money a really good value
3  this is hands down the most affordable and fuel-efficcient suv/crossover that is available on the market not only that it's a top safety pick and is loaded with all kinds of options mazda is one of the top manufacturers in the biz today 35mpg bose
1  please remove me
1  never have been a big fan of mazda but like this !
1  in looking at this class of car i was interested in the fuel economy the capability of the engine and the zoom-zoom factor that one expects from mazda i am not disappointed this grand touring model with all its features was materially less expensive
3  bought new for a great deal drives like a car room of a mid-size suv inside looks great true 32 mpg freeway with automatic better than the honda crv better than the toyota rav4 in every aspect for something you can drive off the lot under 20k yo
3  if looking for a great crossover suv this one is it in my book i highly recommend this ! if you don't mind the slower acceleration and want the better mileage stick with the 2013 the 2014 is the same car with minor upgrades

1  the car has issues behind if mazda can solve it it is ok because bugs/flaws are reasonable for a first year model but if mazda could not solve it or does not have the right attitude to solve issues it becomes a real problem

3  i own another mazda that i have had for over twenty years without any major repairs they do make fun reliable cars i actually purchased the vehicle in march of 2012 but that choice wasn't available for this review

3  great car- you get a lot for your money lots of technology options for your money and overall a great looking car- that looks drives and feels like a much more expensive unit
3  would highly recommend it is sporty and a great price in comparison to other cars in this class love all the features
1  easily in the top tier of all current mid sized vehicles
3  this is a great car it's fun to drive the only cars that i drove and liked more were the hyundai sonata and honda accord
3  one of the best new cars on the market i use to buy mazda's all the time in the 80 and 90 but left when mazda teamed up with ford but i am back now
3  every detail in the car  starting from the engine  i-loop technology and the sensors to the styling inside and out is very well thought of  and you could easily feel that i would any day prefer a car which is comfortable to drive with all the featur

1  was getting 32 mpg on the highway and now we're getting 32 mpg with the k&n in town

1  excellent car for the money good quality feels solid
3  excellent car did i say the gas mileage is ?
2  i am 100% satisfied

2  love the !
1  anybody looking for a mid-sized car would be making a big mistake by not looking at this car it is simply far and away above the camry accord sonata optima altima and fusion
3  i chose the mazda 6 over the nissan altima and subaru legacy because it had and style and the features i liked best it's a great car and i'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new car
1  an excellent looking and fun to drive sedan mazda's redesign of the 6 is simply stunning and the value delivered both in fuel economy and in safety features is really compelling
1  my reommendation is to test drive it once you do you will end up buying it
3  the only fault i can find in the 2014 mazda 6 is that it is taking me a little time to adjust to the difference in power after owning a 2011 grand touring with the v6 the 25 gas is more than sufficient for any type of driving unless you are like me and
2  i compared with camry accord and altima and decided to go with 6 i'm happy i made that decision
1  the 2014 mazda 6 is the clear choice for those looking for an overall nice vehicle which is fun to drive it has many technological advances with luxury sedan safety features young or old you'll love the new mazda 6
1  best new mazda in !

1  out of all the cars out there this one just did not work for me if i just wanted a dd it still would not be the speed3 and as far as performance its useless
2  with the tech package you get everything you can wish for in a car for under $30k
3  according to experts out there this car is a race car so not for the beginner lots of power but will remain calm and composed if driven as such lots of fun to drive and commands respect on the road
2  i do recommend getting this if you want something cheap and quick its a great car to have as your 2nd car its a solid car and really enjoyable to drive
1  this car punches way out of it's price range and should not be sold or loaned to anyone under 25 with out close adult supervision
2  great little hot hatch if you want performance for the money i would highly recommend this car and if you can swing it get one with the tech packagei love !

1  zhas exceeded my expectations in all areas of performance handling and style her appearance is that of a higher priced vehicle when purchasing a brz even though there is a back seat factoring in comfort it really is a two-seater  which is great
2  just recently was fortunate enough to get one love everything about it
2  great car i love mine and so has anyone who has driven in it with !
2  lightweight good horsepower for the size fun to !
3  great ! worth taking car of
2  this is the car to buy if you want the near perfect balance of style performance appearance and quality no sloppy turbo with lag and the constant replace it every 50000 mile problem
1  great looking car at a not so great price when you should have recieved the ultimate machine from subarujust like mitsu and thier eclipse both companies missed the mark of what we want as tuners/sport car driversimho
1  with couple of options the price reach 30k many options available at 30-35k such as sti evo nissan z for 25-28 k i rather go for rallliart wrx base nissan z
2  would buy this car again
1  excellent vehicle for someone who appreciates driving
3  i am not trying to knock the brz not by any stretch i sell cars and i get to drive an exorbitant amount of vehicles in a month's time the brz just did not wow me at all the way i was hoping it would and i was disappointed i feel like this car has t
2  i would by this car again in a heartbeatfantasic car
1  got out with a mile-wide smile
3  fun fun  funyeah an extra 30 hp would be nice but not a deal breaker radio could be better tooive got the limited and i think its well worth the 28 grand i paid got the car for msrp yet to see another on the road in denver 
2  overall recommended for a sporty fun car to afford one many smiles that is affordable not a speed demon but find the curves and corners and you can imagine yourself in a very high end car driving experience very easlily
2  an incredible !
1  great platformhoweveri am going to wait for the sti version or the 2014 wrx or when a 4x4 version becomes available
1  still a very fun car to drive which turns alot of heads looks more expensive than it is
1  diappointing price for a car lke that
1  good value for the money but a gti or mazda might have a bit more pep i love the design perhaps in a year or two they will enhance the engine
1  if you just want a toy to play around with and don't live in the snow belt this is a good car to play with there is no way i would drive this car in winter weather which makes this car  unusable almost 5 months out of the year i was crazy for buy
1  great driving car
2  absolutely outstanding - a home run for !
1  subaru hit it out of the ballpark with the all new 2014 ! looking to be motor trend suv of the year for 2014
3  this car is a winner i got out of my 2012 forester lease early to buy this vehicle and it's my 3rd forester the car is more solid and the cvt transmission is quiet and delivers greater than the mpg stated the info center has about 6 screens you can lo
3  this is a terrific vehicle i traded up from a 2010 and don't regret it i feel the subaru delivers on the things i need: safety visibility and utility including handling rough roads; my complaints are about the more subtle details of the vehicle re
2  our first subaru test drove all the competition and the subaru blew them all away great vehicle
1  excellent car for the money
3  great car and much more for your money than rav crvoutlander or equinox the others we considered the electronic power steering took a couple days to get used to but now i love it to top it off subaru also offers free break pads and wiper blade rep
3  i hope that subaru corrects this in the near future i now have to hope my wife wants to drive a stick shift model
3  i purchased by costco auto program they directed me to grand subaru bensenville il 32i limited andi got awesome price for all models i had to wait 8 weeks since 2014 model is sold out
1  great !
2  great ride
3  was prepared to buy but i think subaru took a step backward on seat comfort and steering feel test drove the mazda cx5 first and compared to that model the subaru lags in handling and road feel the mazda was fun to drive but the subaru felt lumbering
1  well built solid feel and very comfortable aside from the defrost issue it's an excellent value
3  the basic interiors such as small glove box and door pockets could be improved we also think the forestershould be made here in the us like the outback we almost bought an outback and are sorry we didn't sinceit's more roomy and a better value for th
3  love the subarus and this is my 3rd one but hate that speedometer
3  the turbo version drives very smoothly and quietly with only a touch of hesitation the outstanding bad spot is a big side pillar making left shoulder checks cumbersome and therefore dangerous appearance is a wash - the 2014 looks bloated with an aggre
3  bot 25i premium i was surprised at the acceleration with cvt rear camera is good but screen could have been a little biggerride is very good and controlled the view around the vehicle is good  no blind spots sunroof is huge legroom front and rear
3  overally i would choose this vehicle again i was deciding between the rav 4 crv and forester the forester provides the best bang for your buck the rav 4 and crv in front wheel drive costed more than the all wheel drive forester
2  great car
1  great performance and safety record
1  great vehicle for a family - for single guy driving in city not so sure
3  i really wanted to like this vehicle besides it's unnecessarily conservative looks but how can you buy and drive a vehicle with substandard ? lacking in cushioning thigh support and side bolsters to hold you in place while turning ? it is
1  well put together the total package
2  love love love this ! it is !
3  great vehicle  wish the extra's  hitch  cargo cover etc were included in the price since it is supposedly an suv  but other than that i think subaru did a good job only time will tell if i become a subaru groupei
3  if subaru fix the seats and the steering it will be good for the price hope they have fixed the head gasket and oil consumption issues with this new design we had 3 subarus had lots of issue with 2003 forester 2010 forester was better but had oil co
1  i think the forester is a great vehicle i just can't buy one at this time as i would feel a little embarrassed driving it the look is so dated they could do so much more inside is roomy but they made front seats smaller annoying who doesn't offer
3  there is nothing to compare subaru to there is no other manufacturer that can deliver a unbeatable awd system and almost 9 of ground clearance for $20000
2  overall the forester is a great vehicle i researched like crazy before buying itand am very !
2  overall this is best car ever !
1  the msn website has minimal information to work with and much what is here is wrong you have drive the forester to appreciate it it is a far better buy than the outback because the outback is selling too well for dealers to price it more fairly all su
3  i looked at 3 other competitors which i had researched & all would have been excellent choices i settled on the subaru because i felt it provided the most features for the price & was the top choice of consumer reports for quality & safety review id:
1  run don't walk to get !
1  i owned two rav4's prior to this 2014 forester they were both garbage in comparisonthis forester is the best thing under $30000i tested the rav4 escape crv and reviewed the others they were pathetic in comparisoncheck out some of the comparison v
2  owned many cars and suv's this could be the most fun suv i've driven
1  great
3  we have not bought a new car in years and researched alot and drove alot of suv's this lived up to our expectations it won suv of the year in a car !
1  overrated will not let you state your opinion 
1  this vehicle is hard to beat for it's price this is another reason why subaru sales are soaring
1  great suv
2  highly recommend the car
2  must have to go up to the snow
3  a great little car that feels bigger than it is excellent fuel economy and handling here in the midwest the awd comes in real handy snow rain freezing rain you never know what you'll get i ski bike and kayak the roof racks and storage are great
3  i absolutely love this car in the hatchback i use it as a city car in nyc and it fits that role perfectly it handles great takes potholes like a champ the visibility while driving is perfect and i feel like i can see everything that is going on aroun
2  a great car if you want a car that feels big and still gives you mpg and awd at a great price
3  love ! safe zippy small tough reliable
3  overall this is a wonderful car for me as i drive it back and forth to work daily i save on fuel costs with the fuel efficiency it offers and i don't have to worry about the weather conditions with the all-wheel drive so it is safe and economical an
1  great deal all around i looked at vw tdi wagons and their premium price tag was not worth the extra 2 mpg's
1  great car
1  excellent car although acceleration is slow handling and breaking is very good i get about 32 mpg combined which is excellent for an awd car the car looks good and is very simple which is good for reliability it will get you where you need to go in
3  i wanted a compact wagon or hatchback with all wheel drive not too many of those from which to choose but the impreza suits my needs perfectly i can park it easily in the city i get the advertised 36 mpg on the highway where i spend much of my time
3  im used to high perfomance 200+ hp but this is the first time ive actually been impressed with the impreza its great all around because with the awd you dont feel the lag from fwd cars when you accelerate people now days mostly need to sprint to 40mph
2  if it's not for the oil consumption i love this car
3  most fuel efficient and economical all wheel drivevehicle out there for a best buy ! now i hear the xvcrosstrek will be produced as a hybrid in 2014 which will make leaps and bounds for the subaru name as being a fuel efficient economical automobile
3  very good small car does great in the snow very pleased with this car
3  great little 5 door hatchback i have yet to buy a new car with good tires there are far better tires that cost less than the stockones that came with this car road noise level much reduced with tire change out handling also improved and snow traction
3  the awd and safety features gives a very secure feeling when driving excellent gas milage considering it has all wheel drive i average around 30 mpg in the city simple and reliable comfortable and spacious for passengers with excellent cargo versatil
3  i had this car for couple days when my 09 impreza sedan was in for service at first i was not impressed with the car even though the interior was a good improvement over the previous generation subarus i'm not a fan of hatchbacks but after driving it
1  versatile !
2  i own a 2011 sti hatch with plenty of hp awd brembo brakes and tuned sport suspension it's a real performer
1  great fun and you can drive it in the wintersti and snow tires is there anything more ?
2  seriously consider this car for the 25-30k rangegreat feel easy to drive great performance when you need it in awd
3  while not the perfect car its engine awd and suspension more than makes up for its deficiencies its rally heritage can be felt and it gives the driver a raw and exciting feeling of a true drivers car to get this feel usually requires paying much more
1  if you enjoy the driving experience while keeping practicality this is the car for you the 265 turbo-charged 4cyl engine will push you back in your seat with virtually no turbo-lag but at normal driving speeds you'll get about 25 mpg very comfortab
2  i think i will injoy this car for years to come
2  love this car can't ever imaging owning anything but a subaru
2  get this car cant beat the value for the price and the gas milage
1  just because it's awd you will for sure need snow tires the tires they come with are summer tiresafter adding snow tires winter driving is way better
2  i would recommend the legacy to everyone out there looking for a dependable and affordable !
1  good family car what i have come to expect from subaru
3  overall i'm very happy with the legacy time will tell how trouble free it is but subaru does have a good reputation also it is built in indiana by american workers non-union i suppose  which is a plus in my book the engine and cvt are built in
1  don't wait your time
1  975
3  cvt is not perfect but easy to live with paddles are ! will buy the same brand
1  ok for the price but not what i want drove for about 2000 mi on vacation and still had trouble starting smoothly - i can do better with a standard or automatic
1  i intend to buy one soon
2  love this car i don't why i never looked seriously at a subaru before
3  this vehicle is the best value i have owned and that includes hondas cadillacs audis acuras and infinitis this is the swiss army knife of !
3  if you are not in a hurry and want a solid wagon with awd a decent cargo area and nice build quality this is the vehicle for you however if you even remotely care about driving feel look elsewhere acceleration is dog slow and noisy the cvt cau

1  this car is an all around winner luxury when you need it with the outdoor fun when you want it she is a beautiful car with many admirers - i am really enjoying having a look good; go anywhere; haul anything !
3  after months of test-driving and researching - we bought the outback and could not be happier the outback rides nice handles like a car in traffic but has ground clearance and interior space of a crossover or suv quick acceleration esp for a 4-cyl
3  overall this is the best outback i've owned the styling is classy the mileage is very good and the eyesight feature is fantastic it rides well on long trips and can carry a lot of stuff
3  the quality of this car combined with its utilitarian nature is outstanding i can not wait for the first snowfall in snow it out performs my jeep wrangler this is the perfect !
2  good vehicle but needs some tuning to be perfect
3  probably one of the best vehicles we have ever owned consumer reports states subaru is 2nd best and we can deifnitely see it in our ! only lexus comes close but a difference of almost !
1  go with the 6 cylinder for better performance
2  love this car so far
1  they think of everything for those of us in snow country
2  excellent vehicle and value for the money couldn't be more pleased i've owned two subarus and love the cars and the brand
1  great value
1  a good sturdy car that handles snow well
2  i am totally satisfied with this outback i purchased it in dover delaware  from a winner dealer !
1  great value but at performance sake
3  this is a very solid car and is a great buy for the money i would highly recommend going with the 36 so that you can get a normal transmission
3  excellent transportation for the dog and ! i live at the beach but have not made the opportunity to check out the 4 wheel drive feature on the sand
2  waste of time regretted within hours should have stayed with chevy or tried ford
1  excellent multi-purpose vehicle
2  car runs great i'd buy it again
2  i had considered a toyota & honda models with this vehicle and the valve of not paying extra for all wheel drive and the excellent reviews by the automotive editorials sold me
1  love this car our first suv and i only wish that i had gotten one before but am happy with this one
2  this is my first subaru ever after 20 years of toyotas so the bar is set pretty high i can live with the dislikes i mentioned above as all cars have their quirks and i am more interested in long term reliability i bought the outback because of the aw
3  we love this car overall it seems to get a lot of negative reviews but the motor has a lot of power it has a very attractive interior and is built in the usa what more can you ask for from an ? the biggest complaint is that it is impossible to fit
3  i have owned this car since mid-december 2012 and have put ~2000 miles on it driving in rain snow mud streams cold weather and a few days of temperate weather the car has delivered on all expectations the interior is comfortable and roomy it is
3  great car i think it has the potential to become a new subaru flagship if you're really concerned about the lack of unneeded horsepower i would wait for '14 - perhaps subaru will add a v6 or 4-cyl turbo option
2  fell safe in it great looking crossover !
1  this sporty crossover is a great find at this price point
3  overall this is a great vehicle i love it wish it drove a bit quieter and was a bit quicker merging into highway traffic but the tradeoff is great mpg and if those are the biggest complaints i think it's a !
3  handles extremly well in all weather conditions including snow easy to drive and park both in urban/forest environment the luggage room is enough for most of the family trips easy to handle and safe in case you have small children
3  a great small sized crossover with appealing looks great roomy interior with very good seating typical subaru built like a tank and should last for several hundred thousand miles
2  we love this vehicle so farour first awdand it has avery short turning radius and the ride is food for a small suv
2  regardless of the few flaws  i absolutely love ! i have no regrets i actually can't wait for this winter to drive it and know i'll be safe and able to get down our unplowed roads with ease
3  i'd recommend this car over any similar car in it's class or pit it against any luxury vehicle offering a similar set-up i also drive a jeep and a ridgeline and they serve a different purpose and are fun vehicles also but this is my little gas sipper a

3  i am very pleased with this car so far i consistently get around 30 mpg and have gotten 34 i put some bikes on the back and that acted like a parachute so i only got 25 mpg that time that kind of mileage means it is no race car but it gets down the
1  love this car
2  love !
2  we've only had the crosstrek for a few weeks and it is awesome it is fun to drive has enough power to do what's needed before we purchased we looked at many compact crossovers and to get awd with the features of the crosstrek would cost $1000's more
3  i've owned this car for about three months and put around 2500 miles on it so far this has been a fun car i bought it just as winter ended so i haven't gotten to test it out in the snow yet in heavy rain it handled excellent it was like the roads

2  nice crossover recomend to everone
3  the dealership here in louisville is fantastic hands down better service than the mercedes dealership trade in came from dont promise what they don't deliver and very organized buying any car no matter how costly is a compromise i have been through
1  i give it an a+++++
3  again i feel like the xv is more meant for teenagers the rides a little bumpier so if you have a bad back it might not be the best thing for you the car isn't particularly fast at least with a launch but it feels fast i can definitely go adventuring

1  a solidly built nissan with a suzuki !
1  that's a sensible answer to a chlalengnig question
1  a great little !
2  definitely the best value out there for the moneybelieve me i took my time on this purchasenot happy that other brands want to give you a 36 months warranty andthen sell you a $260000 extended warranty
2  i would buy it !
1  very capable and competent small suv worthy of a try
2  good value for money no major problems good off-road handling
1  if you want a reliable truck that is good on gas and i would last a long time buy a suzuki if you want pretty go somewhere else

2  would not buy this kind of car !
3  suzuki has done an outstanding job with the kizashi my wife and i love this car and i expect to see them more and more on the road
2  this car is simply ! this car truly feels like a high-end german car in that everything works together and makes you feel connected to the car its steering is tight and communicative its handling is razor-sharp and its overall feel is positive
1  as a car enthusiast engineer and master automobile technician i i have driven and/or owned almost every car imaginablei wanted an inexpensive awd vehicle that would get reasonable fuel economy i came across the kizashi by accident when looking for su
3  i know some reviews mention it lacks horse ! says 89 gasoline and a k&n air filter can't be ? the same people probably don't know how to manipulate the cvt ! folks just know how to floor it  ? i love this thin
1  best car you've never heard of
2  you can't buy this car anymore but if you can find a good used one it's a unbelievable value i'm a huge fan off the size style sportiness and comfort
2  shame on suzuki for not knowing how to market a great car
3  great car not only for the money safe as houses and performs well you could pay double and not have what this vehicle has
1  ok but seriously considering a suburu or vw r
2  great car get one before they are all gone

1  great package if you want a car that is not around every corner like a subaru/ honda/ toyota just a shame nobody knows more about this car
3  i do a lot of driving for my job so i rotate between multiple vehicles to spread the usage i always smile when it is the kizashi's turn to get me around since suzuki has left the us market any replacement vehicle i buy will be a letdown
3  suzuki announced in december that it was no longer selling cars in the usa i bought mine from a dealership with a chrysler connection the dealership promised that parts should be available
2  race to a suzuki dealer to get one before they're gone for good
3  you cannot go wrong with the kizashi everyone say's thats a suzuki ! but now that they are pulling out of the us market i will take extremely good car of this a one of a kind automobile thank you suzuki
1  i love this car
1  great car that has quality written all over it
2  besides i'll be spending a fortune on tires if something isn't corrected its a great little car
2  i would recommend the kizashi to anyone looking for a quality mid size sedan at a reasonable cost
2  solid car well built i just went swimming for 40 minutes forgot the key fob in my pocket and it still worked even though they said dont get wetit was under water the whole time
2  i have owned car for 1 year and it has been a very capable performer

1  a good work car
1  there is no better deal for a quality awd anywhere period
1  i really do like this little car
3  great idea styling & features terrible execution poor reliability i bought this new in 2007 but this website is making me choose between 2011 & 2012
2  sold it in less than a year for awd used matrix a better all around value
3  can't believe they stopped making these in america japanese designed small suv i have the 6 speed model which gives descent pickup for a four wheel drive vehicle
1  nice vehicle to bad it going out of north america

2  great value for the $ awd great in the snow253 mpg in awd modeaudio system greatsuperior braking and handling i own 2 sx4 crossovers and both perform well
3  don't look for tons of room-it is essentially a small car with awd also you'll sacrifice some trunk room-but the seats do fold down for extra space
3  if you want to get more than you paid for this is the car the quality styling and features included are more than was expected at this price i'd buy again if i didn't step up to the kizashi
3  pretty darn good car for the price so far time will tell
3  this is a small car and when buying a car like this don't expect a big car space or total comfort this car will do very well for what it is desighned for

3  very good vehicle and fun to ! well worth the !
2  overall this is a really solid feeling truck with ample room to take the whole family camping or to the lake well still providing relatively good gas mileage for a larger suv i refer to it as a truck because behind the wheel this is really what it feel
3  great ! i traded in a chevy 3/4 ton diesel for this 4runner after we sold our fifth wheel the toyota is easy to drive park and fits in the garage almost scary how well it does off road and how smooth everything feels if you dont need to tow he
3  overall i'm really happy with all aspects of this vehicle dealer told me that this 5th gen 4runner is back to it's roots of being a 4runner and no longer on the path to family cuv like previous generations i think i agree with this statelment i think

1  start !
2  great truck that really holds its value parts are abundant and reasonable price in addition very cheap to maintain runs off unleaded gasoline
2  excellent vehicle for off road use or on road touring lots of people notice and get questions wow what is ?
3  we have a 1992 camry xle with 150000 miles never misses a beat i expect the same quality from the 4 runner toyota has never let us down
3  i went to upgrade my ltd 05 to the new 2010 and was shocked keep in mind that i use my 4runner for boat hauling fly fishing adventures snowy ski trips and downtown business meetings toyota takes its flagship ltd and strips most of the features that
2  so far best suv i have !
1  real body on frame suv
3  solid truck built for off-road but regular driving feels like a chore slow acceleration at low speeds picks up at higher speeds turns have to be negotiated slowly unless you like that falling-of-the-seat sensation braking is fast and secure but yo
3  this is the suv that i have been looking for the last 3 years the explorer and jeep were incredible vehicles but i wanted a true truck to handle anything i can throw at it
3  great suv still body on frame so it will do what others would like to be able to do and still do it in style trail edition if you are serious off roader sr5 if you are not looking to spend money and limited if you want it all
2  would highly recommend to others
1  real suv
1  a great !
1  i think that toyota did a great job on the redesign as i never considered purchasing the previous models because they were just too stodgy
3  this car is a bargain nicer than the lexus and costs less fantastic ride with a comfortable interior mpg is very impressive
3  the best car under 40k hands down plenty of space plenty of options interior is a huge upgrade from last years model please check this car out after you have driven the rest you will buy an avalon a lexus without the lexus price tag
1  2013 toyota avalon is a bold surprise from the toyota brand this rendering of the avalon gets more style and sleek lines flowing through-out the design body wheels can be fitted from 17's to 18's and that chrome grill gives the avalon some swagger usi
1  fast fun  and smooth at high speeds
1  really good car after all
2  good car love !
3  i don't know where you'd find a better car in the low $30k price range i've tested & driven buick regal and lacrosse as well as cadillac ats really small for my 6'1 frame cts bmw & lexus and for my money this car beats them all if you're hung up
1  it is a great looking vehicle and quiet
2  my next car will definitely be from a different company
3  the avalon is an unpretentious auto that has surprising performance characterisitics great quality relevant features if i had to make a new car decision again i would still opt for the avalon
2  if you get the limited model make sure you take your smart phone in the car and play something via bluetooth on the stereo or bring in a cd that you know has a song with low bass sounds and test your stereo with some volume if the front speakers rattle
1  99
2  toyota knocked it out of the park with this avalon i would definitely buy another this is a super smooth comfortable fast luxury sedan without the luxury price tag
3  i think this car is a great buy this is my third toyota and they have not disappointed me !
2  best automobile we have purchased in 30 years

3  this is an amazing vehicle it has every thing you could ask for comfortstyle economy and easy of the pocket book we researched and shopped for 3 months before purchasing in our opinion this was by far the best value in it's class without breaking t
3  if they would fix the road noise issue and make the radio and speaker system as good as the gm and chrysler products they would have a winner these items make supposedly toyota's top of the line car not such a great driving experience
3  a great car that feels and looks good spacious well-appointed interior very comfortable road car that gets great gas mileage a power upgrade would be nice
2  great car
3  love our car i think it's a great ! love how it handles the road beautiful !
1  toyota did a great job with the redesign for their flagship i love it shares many parts wuth lexus so if you don't require the prestige nameplate avalon is a better choice
2  recommended
3  i rent and drove it for 5 days and 800 miles it feels like a strong smooth and high quality car as mentioned above they tried to add some fancy touch screen and a/c control but they failed at this point in my opinion
3  a great car i love it and enjoy the driving experience it seems priced right and i expect to see more on the raod as of yet i have not seen another on the road
1  great job toyota for working hard on the all new redesigned avalon its just smaller for a large vehicle but saw few on the road and website its a beautiful car someone was in the market for a $40000-$50000 car i would talk them into buying a avalon it

2  we traded in our 2007 avalon limited for this updated model and simply love itthe v6 had way more get up and go than the hybrid duh and we liked that so we'll just pay gas for that 'feature'styling is a bit blah compared to other cars but we're ok
2  we love the car and actually purchased it over a lexus es 350 and mercedes e-350 which left our pocket book $20k + richerthe technology built into the car is overwhelming the car comes with several well documented manuals for the owner two months lat

2  a quality touring sedan that's a pleasure to drive with outstanding gas mileage in hybrid trim
1  an extremely nice vehicle the gold-standard in where all manufacturers should be aiming in comfort handling room for a family and fuel economy
2  i highly recommend this car
2  would do it again but maybe xle just for the seating but all the extras were not worth the $$ for us always get 40 to 42 mpg as calculated by me and not the automatic system
3  i really like this car it fit my needs quite well so far no rattles in 1 year usage 11000 miles absolutely rock solid at this point
2  very comfortable driving comfy comfy ride for passengers
3  this is a great car averaging 40mpg around town and up and down hills voice activation a ! great audio
2  before the camry i owned the 2008 prius and the take-off power with the camry is significantly better and feels equivalent to my v8 dodge ram truck also the transition from engine to electric only is a lot smoother than the prius barely noticeable and
2  just a sweet vehicle i got an xle hybrid with all the options at this point i'm getting 40-41 mpg--unbelievable for a car this powerful has great interior and feature-packed dash very roomy--i'm 6'3and 300

1  you can never be wrong choosing rav4
