1 The seating is excellent as is the comfort for 5 people on Extended Trips...


infiniti g
2 The steering is sensitive - very little movement causes an immediate change.


infiniti g
2 Acceleration is very sensitive too - a very slight change in foot pressure results in an immediate speed change.


infiniti g
2 This combination means you have to really pay attention to what you're doing (i.e., driving is more demanding than relaxing).

1 The instrument layout is different from previous cars I've owned, so there was a bit of a learning curve to get used to the differences.I had trouble immediately after delivery of the car - the engine would die whenever the fuel level got down to a quarter tank or so.

2 It was custom ordered from England - British Racing Green with white bonnet stripes, webspoke wheels, convenience and premium packages and driving lights... a fantastic classic package!This is a 2nd car and I am grateful I did not opt for the Sport package as the sport suspension would have likely made the car a intolerable for the long term, without the Sport package the ride is smooth and above par from other small cars.


infiniti g
2 It handles great and the Sport button is fantastic when I am in the mood to be aggressive (about 60% of the time) while the rest of the time I prefer to be relaxed and somewhat passive.

1 The Sport button is just the greatest idea ever and it is standard - I have 2 cars in one and basically not too bored at all with it.

2 In fact, I thought that I would drive it very little but I am driving the car most of the time instead of my Infiniti G35 Sedan.It motivates me to just take a drive for no reason and going to the canyons (Topanga, Malibu, Kanan Road, etc...) is the greatest adventure.

2 As a matter of fact, I am totally entertained when I see a MINI in the opposite direction and they are always waving at me - I have learned to wave or flash my lights in a friendly response or don't even wait for another MINI owner to wave at me (I am not a MINI maniac but do enjoy the comraderie associated with this car).

1 This is a fairly long but extensive review.

infiniti g
2 If you can get a used Mini with a low mileage, 20k is definitely a good buy.


infiniti g
1 Buying one new with all the fixings that YOU want, however, can be really expensive depending on your dealership.

1 Gas MPH is not good.


infiniti g
2 Maintenance and other expenses can really add up if the only service you can get is at a dealership (and even then they're not 100% reliable).DYNAMICS:


infiniti g
1 For a layperson who wants to feel sporty, an S is really great.


infiniti g
2 The car is responsive, grippy, and zippy.


infiniti g
2 I don't race cars, nor do I ever want to, so my inexperience with that is why it's a 9/10.RELIABILITY: Like I said above, the Mini has a really high rate of failure and problems.


infiniti g
2 It's very possible that one of the previous owners drove it badly and didn't bother to maintain it, because when I took it to a dealership a month after I bought it, they found broken parts around the timing belt and multiple punctures in the tires.


infiniti g
1 However, other reviewers online will tell you that their first-owner cars have also had such problems, so beware of both possibilities.DESIGN: The car is really very small on the outside, so obviously things have moved around a bit to make space on the inside.


infiniti g
1 It takes a little time to get used to where everything is, and sometimes certain notches can be hard to get to if you have short limbs, but overall it's pretty good and efficient.Quality: See reliability & value above.Comfort: This car is not comfortable.


infiniti g
2 It's a sporty car with very little suspension, so you will feel almost everything on the road.


infiniti g
2 However, due to its small size, it's a VERY convenient car.

1 I always try to take this car when I'm going into a city, because parking is easier to squeeze into and traffic is easier to navigate.

1 Despite appearances it's also fairly spacious if the people sitting in the front aren't giants.VERDICT: Buy it for fun, ideally used, and try to get one under warranty.


infiniti g
1 If it doesn't break during your warranty, you might have a good one on your hands.

jeep grand-cherokee
2 I've owned everything from a classic 1970s BMW to a turbocharged Toyota road racer, Nissan 240SX, a mid 80s Toyota Corolla GTS (AE86 - the one that new Scion is supposed to be a successor to), and modified Jaguar along with a few other cars along the way.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 I came into the buying process with a few simple criteria: the car I was going to buy needed to be a sporty coupe with great driving dynamics that would be just as home on the occasional track day as it would be cruising the interstate.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 Finally, it had to look and sound great.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 Quite a tall order, but a few cars came to mind as suitable candidates.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 I wasn't particularly concerned with practicality since I am a young single guy.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 No family or large pets to haul around, so this would be the time to take advantage and get something cool.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 Beside the 370Z I also considered the Ford Mustang GT, Chevy Camaro SS, a used Porsche Cayman S (2007-2009), BMW 335i sedan, and Hyundai Genesis coupe.


mitsubishi galant
1 For a big vehicle it has great acceleration.


jeep grand-cherokee
2 I test drove each car and found the Z to be the best combination of the elements I was looking for.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 The BMW, although not a coupe, was considered due to it's impressive and well known handling dynamics.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 When it came down to it, once you started to spec it out, the price quickly ballooned out of control.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 Along with the extra set of doors I wasn't really looking for, that was enough to cross it off the list.The Porsche Cayman is an incredible machine.


jeep grand-cherokee
2 It's everything the 911 used to be, without the idiotically placed engine.


jeep grand-cherokee
2 Brand new this car was far out of my price range but it could be had for well under $45k if purchased used.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 Unfortunately, there are some problems with this.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 The interior is also way too clinical and German looking, not to mention somewhat cheap feeling.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 The rear spoiler extends when you go above 75 mph, alerting all those around you that you are breaking the law and then some policemen will come to write you many tickets.


mitsubishi galant
1 The interioris well done and very comfortable.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 This would not be fun.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 After driving the Camaro I found that I hated nearly everything about it: the steering, the interior, and the fact that you could barely see anything out of it in any direction.


jeep grand-cherokee
2 The thirsty 6.2 liter V8, while very nice sounding, would not be very kind to my wallet.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 That and way too many people drive them in southern California and Las Vegas.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 If comparing these two muscle cars, I thought the Mustang was miles better than the Camaro.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 This car came the closest of all to being parked in my garage in the Z's spot.Lastly the Genesis.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 It seemed like too good of a potential value to pass on without at least test driving.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 It looks pretty similar to the Z.


mitsubishi galant
1 A negative is the 22" wheel thou looking good are poor in quality.


jeep grand-cherokee
2 It has a big V6 just like the Z (but with less power), big Brembo brakes and sticky wheels/tires just like the Z, and was the cheapest of the bunch.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 This car reminded me of the older 350Z which I had driven many times; lots of good qualities but lacking in refinement.


jeep grand-cherokee
2 I think this should be an awesome car in another generation or two of it's development.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 The body's curves are much more exotic and sleek looking than any of the other cars.


jeep grand-cherokee
2 It loves to be revved, and you will always be happy to oblige.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 Although it doesn't feel as smooth as it could be at the highest points of the rpm range, it certainly delivers the best sounds in the V6 business.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 Which brings me to my next point: it's a V6, not a thirsty V8 (although it still requires premium fuel).


jeep grand-cherokee
1 332 horsepower is more than enough to get you into a fair bit of trouble, but at least there isn't a stupid spoiler that will give you away when you let the speed get away from you a bit.I made sure that my car was equipped with the sport package and 6 speed manual transmission.

jeep grand-cherokee
1 The syncro-rev transmission feature is absolutely brilliant and will make even the most lazy driver seem like a superstar behind the wheel.


jeep grand-cherokee
2 So the driving dynamics were pretty much what I wanted them to be, and so was the price.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 It looks especially pretty in the Black Cherry paint that I opted for and 19" Rays forged wheels that came standard with the sport package and draws numerous compliments on a regular basis.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 If you have ever looked in the trunk of a 350Z, you'll notice that any cargo you may put in it will be quickly guillotined by the massive rear strut brace right in the middle of the trunk.


jeep grand-cherokee
2 This was moved forward in the 370Z, which makes the trunk space much more usable.


jeep grand-cherokee
2 I play golf and ice hockey as well as occasionally enjoy weekend camping trips.


jeep grand-cherokee
2 Here they are:-Seats and door panels: My car is equipped with the sport package only, meaning no leather seats and no GPS.


jeep grand-cherokee
2 The door panels are also made of cloth, rather than the much nicer suede of the touring models.


mitsubishi galant
2 Very nice exterior look and the ride is smooth and handles well.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 That black cloth is impossible to keep clean.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 Every time you open your door and push against it, your hand leaves a mark on it.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 You constantly have to wipe it down with a damp cloth to keep it clean.


jeep grand-cherokee
2 This gets old after about a week of owning the car.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 While the seats are fairly comfortable even on longer drives, they could use a little more bolstering given this car's cornering capabilities.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 If you rest your head against the headrest, you can feel the interior support structure slightly pushing against your mid back which makes the seats feel somewhat cheap.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 The seats and door panels mar an otherwise good looking interior (much nicer than the old 350Z).


jeep grand-cherokee
2 Some leather door panels and custom leather Recaro seats are in my vehicle's future in order to rectify these issues.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 They will be pricey upgrades but will make a huge difference in the overall impression the car will give.-Visibility:


jeep grand-cherokee
1 there is barely any out of the rear of this car.


mitsubishi galant
1 The interior looks nice but the dash board buttons are easily changed without the owner noticing the change.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 The rear window is so small that almost half of your rearview mirror is filled with the black trim of the interior rather than a view out of the car.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 The blind spots are also pretty massive, given that you can't actually see anything out of the tiny windows behind the door windows.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 Backing out of parking spots is particularly challenging.


jeep grand-cherokee
2 I am hoping that installing a backup camera will help mitigate some of the visibility problems.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 Forward visibility and to the sides is very good though, so if you're careful and use those big side mirrors effectively you'll be fine.-Traction


jeep grand-cherokee
2 control: While I do enjoy the fact that the traction control is much simpler than the German counterparts in my comparison (it is simply "ON" or "OFF"), I'm not crazy about the way it works.


jeep grand-cherokee
2 When the traction control is on, it's very quick to jump in and cut the engine's power when it detects even the slightest hint of wheelspin.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 The result can end up feeling a little jerky when driving around.


jeep grand-cherokee
2 Turning it off makes the fun factor go up ten fold.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 This is a car that will understeer if you go into a corner too hot, but that problem is always easily sorted out with a healthy dose of throttle which brings the tail around beautifully into power oversteer.


suzuki grand-vitara
2 We own an Audi S4 and initially gravitated towards the Q5.


mitsubishi galant
1 The compartment buttons are also too easy to open.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 This is all well and good but if you aren't careful, you could very quickly end up wrapped around a tree.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 One must also consider the price of replacing those rear tires if you spend too much time sliding around all over the place.


jeep grand-cherokee
2 Typically I drive the car with the traction control off to avoid the jerkiness of having it engaged, I am just careful not to feed it too much throttle on the street because that almost always quickly turns into a spectacular drift.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 Great on the racetrack and for your ego, not so great when Johnny Law is watching.-The


jeep grand-cherokee
1 triple gauges on the center dash: you can't see them very well during the day when they aren't backlit.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 They look cool at night, but are pointless in daylight.-The


jeep grand-cherokee
1 fuel level gauge and water temp gauge: Again, they look cool at night but are totally pointless when daylight is shining on them.


jeep grand-cherokee
2 I think I'd prefer gauges that matched the speedo and tach rather than the LED layout it uses.


jeep grand-cherokee
2 Tinting my windows helped with this problem.Overall, there are very few downsides to this car.


jeep grand-cherokee
2 It does everything you ask of it beautifully, looks fantastic, and is very quick.


mitsubishi galant
1 Although the radio has a nice touch screen, it does not allow direct access tuning.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 There are a few small issues but this car's virtues far outweigh any shortcomings I have discovered in owning it.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 After having to live with my decision on a daily basis for over 6 months, I am happy to say that I would still make the same choice if given the option.


jeep grand-cherokee
1 As someone who has had the privilege of driving many amazing cars over the years I can say that the 370Z will undoubtedly go down as one of the greats on the list of cars I've owned."

jeep grand-cherokee
2 It makes a point that I love the car so much that I bought instead of leasing (yes you can lease it).


jeep grand-cherokee
1 But it is sooo well worth it.This car handles like a dream even though it's rear wheel but you better be a very good driver to make this car perform at a high rate of speed and this car can take off on just about every car out there and some with higher hp because it's quicker and lighter and has a little thing called Rev Match (only in auto mode shifting with Touring).


jeep grand-cherokee
1 As most of us weave through traffic like they are standing still (no way you can do that in a Vette) you will get good and bad looks.

jeep compass
2 I do have a couple items on my list that could be improved.


jeep compass
2 The electronic steering assist is noisier than I expected and the cabin is not the quietest.

jeep compass
1 The paint chips and the doors dent easily (due to my fault for parking next to careless people) but still I expected it to hold up somewhat.


jeep compass
1 I've already had to use the rust warranty for the trunk because the metal piece was causing the paint to wear off underneath it and rusting (on a 2013 car in 2013).

1 I should have listened.


jeep compass
1 That Altima was a 2.5 liter with a 5 speed manual transmission.


jeep compass
1 It was extremely fun to drive, good on gas and proved to be reliable.


jeep compass
1 Unfortunately, it was totaled in an accident and I quickly needed to replace.


jeep compass
1 Against my better judgment, I went ahead and bought the car with the CVT because I really liked every other aspect of the vehicle.


jeep compass
2 I now have deep regret about the purchase because of the driving characteristics of the CVT.


jeep compass
1 The latter allows you to pretend the car is shifting.


jeep compass
1 It does not improve performance and is bound to put additional wear on a transmission that is already proving to have durability issues.


jeep compass
2 Both modes cause the drivetrain to shudder and vibrate under normal driving conditions.


mitsubishi galant
2 If it worked correctly, it would be the best SUV of 2007.


jeep compass
1 This is due to the load being put on the engine at too low of an RPM.


jeep compass
1 Drivability is severely sacrificed to achieve better gas mileage with this car.


jeep compass
1 The 2013 Altima ends up being a neutered package due to the CVT.


jeep compass
1 This was clearly a conscious and intended choice by Nissan.


jeep compass
1 They could have a made a 6 speed manual available for those that prefer that option.


jeep compass
1 They already had that transmission fully developed and in production.


jeep compass
1 At a minimum, they should reprogram the Drive Sport mode to not lug the engine down at low speeds.For me, the purchase of this car was a costly mistake that I deeply regret and hope others can avoid.

2 Almost bought a Lexus but I had to go American made.


jeep compass
1 I did noticed a fractional noise reduction but the swap did not significantly alleviate the problem.Unfortunately, Nissan is attempting to address the symptom not the root source of the problem... that being the CVT programming.With a simple CVT reprogram offered to those of us who are sensitive to the lugging noise and vibration, Nissan could make this issue disappear practically overnight.Instead


jeep compass
1 Nissan is trying "band aid" fixes like belts and tensioners, presumably, in an effort to keep their EPA estimates intact.


jeep compass
2 At the same time they seem to be abandoning longtime loyal customers.This is an otherwise extremely nice automobile if it were not for the CVT issues and I am hopeful Nissan wakes up and gets serious about resolving this very annoying and frustating issue at once before potential owners start looking elsewhere in this very competive market and before frustrated owners start bailing out." 25 people out of 26 found this review helpful

jeep compass
2 The car has a very firm ride that sometimes is a bit too harsh but overall is acceptable.


jeep compass
1 A few design issues that would be helpful would be to increase the size of the temperature readout and put that along with the compass display either on the rear view mirror as in some cars or incorporate it into the head unit.


jeep compass
1 Not all information is just for the driver.


jeep compass
2 The rear backup camera could be brighter especially at night in dark areas as the image is very dim.


jeep compass
2 The only other improvement would be a greater control over the sound system itself with some mid range controls needed over just treble and bass.

1 We have had our 2013 Altima 2.5SV w/NAV and Convenience pkgs since 7/12, previous to that we drove a 2005 2.5S for 7 yrs w/o any major issues and were quite satisfied with the Nissan brand.

jeep patriot
2 A few minor issues that needed to be worked on but overall the Armada has been fantastic.I've owned a Sequoia>(big mistake), a Trooper, a Pathfinder, a 2008 Armada and now a 2011 Armada.

2 I bought this car brand new one year ago.


jeep patriot
2 In the 5 years that I have owned it I have never been broken down or had a major problem.


jeep patriot
2 I recently had to replace a wheel bearing on the front passenger side, but after countless road trips all over the eastern seaboard, I can't complain to much.


jeep patriot
2 It has been the most reliable vehicle I, or anyone I know, has ever owned.


jeep patriot
2 I know that my family is safe and secure inside this massive tank and it gives me piece of mind when I or my husband is on the road in it.


jeep patriot
2 Most of my friend can't believe how long I've had it, how I've never had problems with it, and how it is so unbelievably comfortable to ride in but still so beautiful from the outside.

2 As another reviewer said, I will be driving this until the wheels fall off....and then I will buy another Armada."

2 This SUV has been super reliable (lone exception: had a transmission cooling line leak, research shows it to be a common issue, but it was a relatively inexpensive fix).It handles well on paved/smooth roads and even in rain and strong winds feels stable and trustworthy.


jeep patriot
2 Unpaved roads and bumpy/badly maintained paved roads are another story...


jeep patriot
2 The vehicle tends to feel unstable over moderate bumps, to the point of feeling as if it "skips" over them rather than just ride over them as it should.


suzuki sx4
2 I did a lot of test driving before I decided on the RDX.


mitsubishi lancer
2 It's depreciated so much more than I thought it would.


jeep patriot
2 Once over them, the ride regains its usual smooth composure, but on badly paved roads or dirt roads, it can get a bit unnerving.Fuel consumption is an issue, of course, but a known one, so I won't go into detail other than to say you know what you're buying when you get this SUV, so you really can't complain about it.Interior touches are many, and everything is well placed within reach except for the stereo controls.


jeep patriot
1 There are some steering wheel controls, but they only scroll up and down through the presets, so if you want to manually change stations (say, in an area where your presets won't work due to distance) then you'll find yourself reaching across quite a distance to make adjustments.


jeep patriot
2 The seats are comfortable, hace a decent amount of adjustments and features (heated, lumbar support), and the inclusion of XM and the rear DVD system makes long rides feel shorter.


jeep patriot
1 Also, the Music Box 8GB hard drive-based system is a nice touch, automatically copying any CD inserted to the drive and allowing search for tracks based on artist, mood, album etc.Finally there are a lot of nice features like tire pressure monitoring, programmable maintenance reminders, lots of storage compartments, AUX jack for iPod or other MP3 players, heated steering wheel, height-adjustable pedals, etc...


jeep patriot
2 The list is long, and you'll use them.When it's time to replace my Armada, I will certainly consider buying another before looking at other makes/models."

2 Let me start by saying, we have owned alot of nissans, and all thier small suv's..


jeep patriot
2 The armada was the obvious next step up.. we have a 04 se and it was love at first sight, love the power, looks of all the nissans..


jeep patriot
2 But this thing is riddleded with problems, brake problems, rattles, chrome door handle broke off, back up sensor quit working, shifter selector is off alittle so you have to pull it past D to get it in gear, fuel pump replaced, dash cluster, battery and check engine light all in 2 weeks.. we bought used and it must have been driven like they stole it,.. cloth seats, what a mistake.. we are very picky and clean with our vehicles, this now after only 1.5 years looks like we rolled in dirt before sitting down everyday.. seats stain BAD even with rain when trying to get inside drops stain.. looks terrible,.


jeep patriot
2 The paint is another thing, several chips on the hood to the metal.. the paint scratches when the wind blows practically.. the early armada's aren't a case IF you have problems its WHEN.. we had NO problems at first and then one after another it started falling apart... and with gas prices the resale value is WAYY to low so now we are stuck in this piece of junk.. upside down because we traded our beutiful pathfinder le platinum 04 after 1.5 years for this truck thinking it would be our last vehicle for some time.. well we got part of that right, our last Armada.. we just bought a 07 sentra 2.0s and love it, loved the Xterra, pathfinder, sentra ser spec V, sentra 07 and hate this for the problems.. and lets not even start about gas for this pig... please consider the mid size suv's from any company... they are tried and true tested , wish we kept ours" 6 people out of 7 found this review helpful

2 I call this thing my Tank / Troop transport, it has got to be one of the best vehicles i have ever owned.


jeep patriot
1 The only reason i give it a 4/5 for overall is because the gas mileage is just horrible, 14-15 window with a probable 13mpg avg.


jeep patriot
1 I am getting 15mpg out of mine but still the gas consumption is atrocious!


jeep patriot
1 I knew this when buying the car.


mitsubishi lancer
1 What a dissapointment for $68000.


jeep patriot
1 But i would rather pay the extra vehicle costs in onwership and in gas, to have all the comfort and room and standard equipment that comes with this car and be comfortable instead of stuck in something small and cramping.


jeep patriot
2 Bottom line, if you drive long distances, this car will cost you a small fortune in gas, but you will arrive comfortable and happy ready for fun, vs, cramped, upset and tired, but you save the gas money....Also i am over 6'3" and 260lbs, all of my friends are big and tall as well, and everyone can fit, even with the seats all the way back and reclined, they will still have between 3-7 inches between their knees and the back of my seat.

jeep patriot
2 We have two kids and on long trips the third row seats allow them to have an entire seat to themselves.


jeep patriot
1 The storage compartments are very useful too.


jeep patriot
1 The main factor that made my final decision of this vehicle and a compertitor brand was that the 3rd row seat folds down flat.

2 I've only had this monster for a year but I'm getting rid of it and surprise, surprise its worth less than half of what I paid for it.


jeep patriot
2 I paid almost $40K for this thing and its got 10K miles on it.


jeep patriot
2 I can only get $21K if I trade it.

2 At that rate, if I keep it one more year, it will be worth about 0. Which to me is too much.

jeep patriot
2 I LOVE my Armada!

1 It is just an all around wonderful vehicle.

2 Enough adjustability to the driving position that my wife of 5' even and me at 6'1" can drive comfortably.


jeep patriot
1 The things that I would change regarding my Armada is that I would like for the fold down arm rest to be higher.


jeep patriot
2 It seems to be about 1" or 2" too low.


jeep patriot
2 Also, I would put a scan button on the steering wheel.

jeep patriot
2 Side mirrors fold in with the push of a button, great for tight spaces.


jeep patriot
1 Wish gas mileage was better but for such a large vehicle it gets the job done nicely.


jeep patriot
1 I wish it had the back row seats lay flat individually instead of the whole bench going down together- it would make the trunk much better--roomier--- It tows great- plenty of leg room in all seats- drives great- looks great- No problems with the engine or the way it runs- great car!

jeep patriot
2 Best SUV I have owned and I've owned a Tahoe and an Expedition, both were good but nothing like the Armada.


jeep patriot
2 Would buy another when/if this one decides to die.


jeep patriot
2 I've owned this since new.


jeep patriot
1 It has the comfort, power, room and drivability to make me keep it over 8 years.


jeep patriot
2 That's the longest I've ever kept any vehicle.


jeep patriot
1 In my opinion, an underestimated and underrated performer.


mitsubishi lancer
2 I walked away with not one scratch.


jeep patriot
2 Must reliable and dependable SUV I've own; Not the best fuel efficient vehicle, but for the size the fuel consumption is reasonable.

jeep patriot
2 Here's our Mada' "We have the 06' SE and have been nothing but happy with it!


jeep patriot
1 When I compared it to the Tahoe, Expedition and Sequoia it was by far the best value in a used car!


jeep patriot
2 We bought ours when it was a few years old but it only had 30K miles on it...the thing was like new but we picked it up for about half the cost of a new one.


jeep patriot
2 So, depreciation (re-sale) is bad, but if you are looking to buy a used SUV and hold it for a while, this is a smart buy.


jeep patriot
2 Drivability is good (my wife drove an Acura MDX for years and was worried but no she loves it) and it feels safe and smooth on the road.


jeep patriot
1 So far no issues with it and gas mileage has been about 13 around town and 18 on the HWY.


jeep patriot
2 The 4WD works awesome in snow and mud, it's very capable...size wise, ours seats 8 and can do so comfortably and while even carrying some luggage.When we carefully compared all the large SUV's in the class, we decided that this was the best buy for our family because we needed a reliable, large hauler with 4x4 that we could keep for a while...best bang for the buck (unless buying new).


jeep patriot
2 We've been round and round about whether and how to replace our Armada.


mitsubishi lancer
1 My car saved my life.


jeep patriot
2 We're in the market for a luxury SUV, but keep coming back to replacing our Armada with another one.


jeep patriot
2 We have small kids and many out of state visitors, and the size and versatility, to say nothing of the value, of the Armada are huge pluses.

jeep patriot
1 Plenty of passing power.


jeep patriot
1 Plenty of storage room, seats lay down, very happy with it.After test driving 2 Kia Souls, which was the car I thought I wanted, I drove the cube and fell in love.


jeep patriot
2 Cube owners are fun folks; we wave at each other when we see another cube.What I do not like: Gas fill on passenger side means my painful hip has to go further to fill, the gas cap release button is really low and hard for me to reach without opening my door, a heavy person would find getting in or out of the back seats a little more challenging than the front; a little higher and not as much open door space but plenty of leg room.


jeep patriot
1 Strong cross winds do affect it and it sits low.

1 Not so with cube, there are big, wide doors and interior room aplenty for a big bull like me.


jeep patriot
2 The safety features are super, VDC makes this little "box" very stable in rain or snow, it's very sure footed, has excellent ABS brakes and all the air bags one can have in a car.


jeep patriot
1 A big plus is it's size, it's shorter than all the other "boxes" and is easily parked in the smallest spots.


jeep patriot
1 I love the quirky "asymetrical" design, the pond ripples on the ceiling panel and the boom box sound system.


jeep patriot
2 It's like a juke box on wheels and seats five adults easily.


jeep patriot
1 With the rear seatbacks down, there's plenty of room to tote almost anything, except maybe a refrigerator.


jeep patriot
1 Like I said, almost perfect!


jeep patriot
1 The A/C vents could use a little tweek, the dash wave design makes it difficult to direct airflow effectively, rear passengers should have their own air vents, the sun visors aren't long enough to shade the side windows and there really needs to be map lights for rear passengers.


jeep patriot
1 A glovebox light would help and Nissan should really consider making all glass energy efficient (e-glass).


jeep patriot
1 There is wind noise on the highway because of the square design, but, it's minimal and doesn't bother me.


mitsubishi outlander
2 It has been reliable so far and it is comfortable to drive, but the inside has so much plastic in it.

jeep liberty
2 My Cube is parked in my garage each night.


mitsubishi outlander
1 At the time, she drove a 95' Cadillac DeVille.


jeep liberty
2 I have had the Cube five months now.


jeep liberty
1 After a few weeks I noticed scratches by the front left wheel, then some scratches on the hood, and in the back, and so on.


jeep liberty
1 Then I got stuck in the recent snow storm here in the northeast (October 2011).


jeep liberty
2 My car was covered with several inches of snow and I only had a plastic shovel to clear my car off with.


jeep liberty
1 Needless to say my car now has scratches from getting the snow off.


jeep liberty
1 There are also several more scratches I cannot attribute to the shovel that I assume were from the highway ride home thru the storm.


jeep liberty
1 So I am making you, the reader, aware that the Nissan Cube comes with a soft paint job that scratches easily.

1 I warned her not to buy an Escalade because Cadillac doesn't produce quality cars anymore.


jeep liberty
2 I have driven my Cube for about 4 years.


jeep liberty
1 It has been reliable and fun.


jeep liberty
2 It is roomy and comfortable.


jeep liberty
1 It has many options and great room for storage.


jeep liberty
1 If you have a larger family you may need more storage space, but I love that I have been able to haul many things a car could not.


jeep liberty
1 The only room for improvement would be horsepower, tire size (new ones are spendy) and in windy conditions it isn't aero dynamic.


jeep liberty
2 I have all in all enjoyed my cube and would recommend it to others!

1 At the same time I had to have the a/c pump replaced.


jeep liberty
1 And to top it all off my car is doing the same thing it did prior to replacing the engine.


jeep liberty
2 I am dreading the idea I have to have the engine replaced yet again.As far as handling, it does not hold up well in the wind.


jeep liberty
2 It gets moved around on the road a lot and make me fearful to drive with my kids in the car during such weather and to make a sharp turn it wants to pull the opposite direction the driver wants to go.I am looking forward to replacing my car all together." 2 people out of 5 found this review helpful

1 The chrome wheels are peeling, the tailgate has been replaced twice, the rear passenger side door handle completely came off when she went to open it, and there are so many rattling noises in the car.


jeep liberty
2 We bought this car brand new off the lot and have had nothing but problems.


jeep liberty
2 The windsheild collects rock chips like crazy, and the tires actually kick rocks up to the side windows.


jeep liberty
2 We've replaced the driver side window twice, repaired 5 rock chips, and are on our second windsheild.

2 MY CUBE IS COMFORTABLE AND ROOMY EVEN FOR MY SIX FOOT FRAME AND LONG LEGS.


jeep liberty
2 IT IS WELL EQUIPPED,FOR THE PRICE.IT IS A VERY GOOD CAR FOR CITY DRIVING.EASY TO HANDLE AND PARK.EASY TO ENTER AND EXIT.LACKS POWER FOR QUICK ACCELERATION,BECAUSE OF THE CVT TRANSMISSION,UNLESS YOU FLOOR IT.HIGHWAY MPG SHOULD BE BETTER,BUT I AM TOLD THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE BOXY SHAPE.LIKE THE REAR DOOR FOR THE WIDE OPEN ACCESS TO CARGO.


jeep liberty
1 People think this car is ugly or funny looking but we can tell you the comfort and space inside makes up for the looks.


jeep liberty
1 What I call creature comforts are all around.


mitsubishi outlander
1 GM has been great and the local dealership has fixed nearly everything that has gone wrong with this car.


jeep liberty
1 Large windows, multiple cup holders, easy to see and use knobs and shifter.


jeep liberty
1 Driving it is fun.


jeep liberty
2 Handles like any car of its size.


jeep liberty
1 Because your sitting up higher than most economy cars you can see all around.


jeep liberty
1 Elderly family members really like this car because of the higher than average seating, and large doors make it easier to get in and especially out of.A couple negatives are the interior plastic, that a lot of cars made now have, mars/scratches easily and has texture that make it hard to clean.


jeep liberty
1 Also the sun visors are overly large and should be longer or at least have a slide out to extend the length when needed.The small size and sharp turning makes maneuvering in and around parking lots easier than average cars.


jeep liberty
1 The sliding back seat helps when needing that extra cargo space.Overall this is a great commuter/transportation vehicle at a very reasonable cost for any family.


jeep liberty
1 34 mpg average mileage saves a lot of money.


jeep liberty
2 It's reliable, fun to drive, comfortable on long road trips.


mitsubishi outlander
2 However, for the amount of money that she paid for the car, these problems shouldn't be happening in the first place.


jeep liberty
1 It has more than enough leg room and head room, I am 6 foot tall and have plenty of room.


jeep liberty
1 It's simple and easy to reach controls, cool design inside and outside.


jeep liberty
2 Has plenty of space to carry things for camping, travel or a trip to the market.


jeep liberty
2 It looks low but so easy to get in and out of unlike many cars thee days.

1 Gets great milage in town and on the highway.

2 One of the best ones I've owned.


jeep liberty
2 its a great car, at first i didn't even want to get in the car but after sitting in and seeing how much head room and room in general i had.

1 Ok, so when I first saw the Cube, I thought it was an ugly car and there was no way I would ever get one.


jeep liberty
2 Til a friend of mine rented one while her car was in the shop and all she did was brag about it and tell me how much she wanted one.


jeep liberty
1 So I decided to give it a test drive.


jeep liberty
1 From that moment on, I was hooked!


jeep liberty
1 I love the head and leg room (very important for a tall person like me) It came with all the bells and whistles, things I never needed but would hate to live without.


jeep liberty
1 It handles great and is a pretty smooth ride and it offers awesome gas mileage.


jeep liberty
1 The only thing negative I have to say about it is that when you drive fast like on a freeway or something, it is a little loud...but the awesome sound system takes care of that problem.


jeep liberty
2 Still unsure about the shape of the car but I love everything else about it.

jeep liberty
1 Would rocommend this car if your looking to down size, very roomy and alot of fun to drive.


jeep liberty
2 Everyone always asks us about our blue cube (ice cube) we love it.


jeep liberty

1 I'm so excited about this car!

mitsubishi outlander
2 My mother, a lifelong Cadillac owner, has vowed to never buy a Cadillac ever again."


jeep liberty
1 Very comfy, practicaol, quirky, and cute!


jeep liberty
1 I was surprised by how much pep it has considering the engine size.


jeep liberty
2 Just got this car through C4C and it was a perfect buy!


jeep liberty
1 The outside styling is very unique and quirky but serves a functional purpose.


jeep liberty
2 The added visibility is a big benefit for city driving.I am a young adult and it serves all my needs for cargo and passenger space.


jeep liberty
1 The cargo could actually be bigger but since there is no loss in passenger comfort so I can let it slide.Driving around town is where the cube shines.


jeep liberty
1 Plenty of people curious about it's unique styling makes for a great conversation starter.


jeep liberty
1 It is peppy enough to satisfy passing and stop and go traffic.


jeep liberty
1 The CVT shines through rigorous traffic always getting optimal MPG.The styling may be ahead of its time but once inside you forget what you are driving and the standard features definitely outweigh any issues you might have.


jeep liberty
2 Fun, economical, and eye-catching, not to mention practical!


jeep liberty
2 I bought the Cube after driving a Jeep Cherokee for MANY years (yay Cash for Clunkers!) and have been surprised by how fun it is to drive (I've got the manual 6-speed).


jeep liberty
2 Fuel economy is good, but the gas tank is so small that I wind up at the station more often than I'd like.


jeep liberty
1 All in all, though, I think I made the right choice.


jeep liberty
1 This solid truck rocks.


jeep liberty
1 The mistake I made was buying a stripped down SE rather than a leather LE.


jeep liberty
2 I miss not having heated leather seats, a sunroof, and a roof rack.


jeep liberty
1 However in September there was only one LE left in the state CO and it was white.


jeep liberty
2 I just gave up a white vehicle and opted for the storm gray SE.


jeep liberty
1 I love the storm gray color.


jeep liberty
1 I like the short bed crew cab with a bed extender and bed divider.


jeep liberty
1 I love the utilitrack tie down bed liner system.


jeep liberty
2 I love the power of the 4 L 261 Hp engine.


jeep liberty
1 This truck leaps off the line.


jeep liberty
1 I was use to 33 mpg from my previous 1984 Nissan pickup truck, which is still running fine.


jeep liberty
1 Nissan does a wonderful job building good reliable trucks.


jeep liberty
1 This truck has much more room than the old style.


jeep liberty
2 It has a durable hard plastic feel to the interior which is anothr reason to get leather if you can.


jeep liberty
1 I hope Nissan manufactures more LE Frontier pickups.


jeep liberty
2 The vehicle handles okay for a truck.


mitsubishi outlander
1 Immediately regretted the decision.


jeep liberty
1 It is larger than I would like and is tough to park around town.


jeep liberty
1 Again I am use to my 1984 standard bed Nissan pickup.


jeep liberty
1 I wish Nissan would make a smaller pickup with better gas mileage.


jeep liberty
1 A TDI would be nice.Great truck for the money.


jeep liberty
1 I also considered buying a Toyota Tacoma which was longer and more expensive.


jeep liberty
1 I am glad I went with the Frontier since it is made in American at Smyrna Tennesse with many North American made parts.


jeep liberty
1 At least some of my dollars are helping out the US economy.


jeep liberty
2 Overall, I am a happy owner of a Frontier and I feel I got a good deal for the money I spent on a 2007 model.


jeep liberty
1 And that is coming from a ND farm boy turned engineer/landlord/snowboarder.


mitsubishi outlander
2 The seats are hard, hard, hard in the new one and the ride equally firm.


jeep liberty
2 I use my trucks hard and the Frontier is a work truck.


jeep liberty
1 Nuf said.


jeep liberty

2 I looked long and hard for a decent used mid-sized pick-up,and I have to admit that the initial search was focused on the Toyota Tacoma,based on referrals and reviews.After several weeks of intense internet and classified searches,my attention shifted to the Frontier.As soon as I got "up close" to one and compared features my mind was made up.I ended up purchasing an "06 Frontier SE 4x4 Crew Cab" and WOW!


jeep liberty
2 What a truck!Not only roomier than the Tacoma,but much more reasonably priced!


jeep liberty
1 The build quality,comfort,and ride was far superior than I had hoped for,and it has the Nissan reputation for reliability behind it.

1 Spent the whole first month parked in my garage because I couldn't stand to drive it.


jeep liberty
2 Way more power with the V6 than I'll probably need,and the fuel milage reflects it if you aren't careful!One "Tie-Breaker" came for me when I called a friend who works as a service technician at a local Dealership that sells and services both the Tacoma and the Frontier.

1 I drove the Tacoma and the Frontier both considerably to compare, and the ultimate winner as far as price goes and value, is the Frontier.The Tacoma has a weaker engine, the bed is flimsy, as well as the frame that the truck rides on, its not a fully boxed frame(Only HALF of the truck is semi boxed, the rest is just open framed) like the Frontier(every respectable truck manufacturer uses fully boxed frames for a reason, they are more rigid and provide better towing #'s).On top of all this, the Frontier rode better, offered way more power and way more features for less money.


jeep liberty
1 The cabin sound from driving is minimal, and the engine noise you hear in the cab is actually a nice pur(as its the same engine used in the Nissan 370Z), as opposed to the Tacoma's engine that sounds like its going to die with its absurd engine whine just mashing the accelerator.The ergonomics of the Frontier is far better, the seat is more comfy and you sit HIGHER in the vehicle than the Tacoma.


jeep liberty
1 The utility between the two as far as truck features go is a no brainer, the Frontier has the option of the utilitrak system which has been phenomenal thus far as well as the Line X'd bed.


jeep liberty
2 The Tacoma has a plastic system like this that is flimsy and weak(in my experience), Id be reluctant to tighten my ratchet straps half as tight as I can on my Frontiers solid Aluminum cleats.Overall it comes down to what you prefer, to me its a no brainer, I want more for my money, and the Frontier gives me that as well as a SOLID reliability rating, the Tacoma has been through recalls and has constant problems with parts going out such as the blower motor for instance.


jeep liberty
1 On top of that, the Frontier is cheaper to insure than the Tacoma is as well which was a big plus to me, as the Frontier has better safety ratings."

2 I bought this truck after careful comparison with the Toyota Tacoma TRD.


jeep liberty
1 I wanted a mid-size truck that would get decent gas mileage, be capable off-road and towing heavy loads for work around the house, and room to haul the family to the mountains for ski/camping trips.


jeep liberty
2 Lots of test drives, value for the dollar, and room for 3 kids in the back seat led me to buy the Nissan Frontier.


jeep liberty
2 After 7 months owning the truck and driving in many different environments, I definitely made the right decision.


jeep liberty
2 Thoughts are as follows:Power: Very smooth and powerful V6.


jeep liberty
2 I have had the truck over numerous Colorado mountain passes fully loaded with kids/hunting gear and it climbs efforlessly.


mitsubishi outlander
2 Center console is very flimsy and within month, it will start to rattle.


jeep liberty
1 Gas mileage better than expected - 22+ MPG from Gunnison to Denver over and down multiple mountain passes with gear.Off-road Capability: Very capable in both snow and mud.


jeep liberty
1 Did not use chains on a recent hunting trip - the rear locker makes all the difference.


jeep liberty
2 Off road ride is better than my old Jeep Wrangler and many friends' Range Rovers.


jeep liberty
2 Received numerous compliments from friends on rocky terrain ride quality.


jeep liberty
1 This is a heavy truck and it pays dividends off-road.


jeep liberty
1 Climbs like a mountain goat.


jeep liberty
1 Nissan could have improved by putting more aggressive tires on the Nismo 4x4 (mud terrain vs all-season).The on-road ride of the Nismo 4x4 is perfect in my opinion - what a capable off-road truck should be - firm but not jaw shattering.


jeep liberty
1 Bump steer at highway speeds could be improved, and the turn radius is wide and takes some getting used to for parking.


jeep liberty
1 I consider these downsides minor vs the many positives the truck has to offer.Overall this is substantial truck for the money.

2 I like the interior room, ride, and power over the Tacoma.


jeep liberty
2 The Tacoma was very torquey and had a ride that did not seem to dampen the bumps - it seemed like I felt bumps multiple times on and off road.

2 The V6 of the Frontier seemed smoother and more consistent through the power band.

2 I had originally talked myself into a Tacoma until I did the test drive and priced each truck.

2 Toyota was disappointingly proud of their Tacoma and it resulted in my test drive of the Nismo and eventual purchase.

1 This car also lacks so much such as START/STOP engine button, power folding 3rd row, keyless entry, and no front blind spot assist.


jeep liberty
2 Some draw backs include, the back seats are not made for grown men, so long rides are uncomfortable and hard on the back and legs.


jeep liberty
2 Also shortly after our purchase, a bolt that rattled loose from the tranismisson case and caused us to replace the bearing, but we were still able to pull the trailer home while this was happening.


jeep liberty
2 We have not had any other mechanical problems since this just minor glitches, for example, some of the lights in the dash have come on since driving in the rain and will not turn off, but they have not affected it's perfomance.


jeep liberty
2 We have the 4x4 and have used it for this purpose, works great.


jeep liberty
1 Normal driving in town is a bit bumpy and sways on turns, but not alarmingly.


jeep liberty
1 Our truck has a six disk cd changer with subwoofer, although there is a draw back with radio when it gets too hot inside the cab, the radio will not work until the ac cools the interior down enough.


jeep liberty
2 Options I wish it offered would be ac vents and softer seats for passengers in the back.


jeep liberty
2 My husband fits in this truck just fine, but being a small woman, I would like to have the pedals come to me instead of my seat coming to the pedals (It creats a situation where my knees are almost touching the dash)and I have to use a back support to be able to reach the pedals and still be able to lean on the back of the seat at the same time.

1 The engine makes a tapping noise and the cheap foam cover under the hood caught fire cause it has no side clamps.


jeep liberty
2 I have had this truck for a little over a year now and in my opinion, it would be hard to beat with another mid size and even some full size trucks.


jeep liberty
1 It has never overheated when I hit the hard hills and kicks in great for that extra pickup.


jeep liberty
2 The truck itself will want to go over that which speaks well of the horsepower.


jeep liberty
2 The only complaint I have, which is also minimal, is the middle department between the front seats could have extended out further to make a better arm rest.


jeep liberty
2 Another than that and the cab room limitations, (all midsize trucks) this is a great truck and I would highly recommend it to others." 3 people out of 3 found this review helpful

2 I also got the Rockford Fosgate system and sunroof/roofrack.I peronally think its a great looking truck...maybe just a little narrow, but this helps on the trails.

2 Ive taken it on some really brutal trails and it performed superbly for a 2wd...rear locker does wonders.

1 Skid plates have come in handy numerous times...and seem to of ample thickness.

1 Going up some of the steep, rockier trails makes me wish i had a manual...or low 4wd...the power just kicks in alittle too much with the automatic and the tires spin alot, even when in first gear.

2 I have the crew cab, and it seems to fit my average sized friends ok...sure they wouldnt be very comfortable on long trips though.


jeep liberty
2 Plenty of space to put things inside...lots of cubholes.


jeep liberty
2 Dual glovebox is pretty cool too.Engine has run superbly thus far...plenty of power for my liking.


jeep liberty
2 Ride is very comfortable...bumps are little stiff but for a truck with offroad shocks its does nicely on the city.


jeep liberty
1 Turning radius is pretty big, but you get use to it.


mitsubishi outlander
2 Overall, there are no serious problems with this car except design and cosmetic defects, but if you do buy it, get an EXTENDED WARRANTY to cover all the future problems and repairs it Will need.


jeep liberty
1 Ive only had it in the shop for one thing other than oil, and that was entirely my fault.


jeep liberty
2 I rammed the fan shroud up on one of my trail endeavors and it was nickin the fan.

1 four wheel drive and traction control are nice on this truck.There are a couple of things that could be improved.


jeep liberty
1 Driver legroom is a little tight and I am not an overly tall guy... 6'2".


jeep liberty
1 The truck is a little sluggish pulling a trailer and definitely does not like pulling up 4% and greater mountain grades.


jeep liberty
2 Also the factory tires are passenger 4-ply BFG's instead of the light truck 6-ply.


jeep liberty
1 Most people will probably not notice this but it is a truck and should have the better tires.


jeep liberty
1 just an area where Nissan tried to cut some cost.


jeep liberty
1 The final thing is probably the most annoying and that is the rock chips on the front side of the rear fender.


jeep liberty
1 Nissan applied a protector to this area but it is not sufficient and you will find identical rock chips on 99% of all used frontiers with this body style.Overall it is a good truck and maintains its value well.

1 The Value Truck Package is a great combination of true "truck" features with limited slip, utilitrack, alloys.

2 Three things to point out are the backseats aren't big enough for bigger kids for long trips, the tan interior seat fabric is very easy to stain and a relatively loud air conditioning compressor that comes on and off making a low metallic rattling sound.

jeep liberty
2 I wasn't disappointed.I bought this SL CC lava-red model brand new, and it has everything I want in a truck, including bling.


jeep liberty
1 In fact it is the coolest-looking pick up going when loaded with roof rack, chrome grill guard, chrome tailgate applique, etc.It has a powerful engine coupled to a smooth transmission for hauling and moving out fast when you need it.Very comfortable and quiet ride.


jeep liberty
1 The interior has all the luxuries, while appearing utilitarian (it is a truck, after all).


jeep liberty
2 The back seat may be a little cramped for adults,, but my kids report they comfortable and roomy for them.The only feature I dislike is the gas mileage.

1 Use all that power often, and you will get pretty bad mileage.


jeep liberty
2 That's not really too bad for a pickup designed to carry loads and hauling, especially considering my '92 SEV6 got 19 mpg and was smaller, lighter, had a smaller engine.To get better mileage, I changed my driving habits to avoid city stop-&-go traffic, and take to the freeway whenever the option presents itself.


jeep liberty
2 Also accelerator is electrical wire, and takes getting used to - best to accelerate briskly to get to cruising speed, and keep the gas in the same position thereafter.I have to also say that I like my dealer very much (gasp).

2 I've had my 06' Frontier Crew cab for two years.The truck has done everything I've asked of it and then-some.I tow with it much more than I had planned and it hasn't caused any extra wear aside form brakes which is to be expected.Towing fuel mileage is excellent.Maintenance is extremely manageable and the truck has never left me sit.The interior leaves some to be desired but I bought a basic model, I'm sure there are options to make it more comfortable.The engine has plenty of power for a V6.

2 I went with the six-speed manual and it's great.

2 Speedometer stops engine at 116 MPH.The steering is tight and accurate at all speeds (unlike my Toyota Tacoma, another truck I've owned, whose steering was a little skittish at highway speed with a headwind).


jeep liberty
1 There are no suspension noises and everything feels solid and built to last (the fully boxed frame is a positive contributing factor, I'm sure).


jeep liberty
2 The interior is also exceptionally quiet (again, comparable to my Toyota Tundra and better than my Toyota Tacoma).


jeep liberty
2 It makes the Frontier feel more like a luxury vehicle.


jeep liberty
2 I've not take my Frontier off road, but have had the chance to use it during the winter when we had some heavy snow, ice & freezing rain.


jeep liberty
1 I can say definitively that the Frontier's 4 wheel drive system works flawlessly.


jeep liberty
1 It felt very sure-footed, I never had a loss of traction and I know that I would've slid off the road or gotten stuck without it.


jeep liberty
1 Having said that, you still have to keep in mind that even the best 4 wheel drive system won't help you stop any sooner, so you still have to drive cautiously.


jeep liberty
1 Also the Frontier is unique in that it has a 4 wheel electronic Limited Slip System that works even in 4 wheel drive (the Tacoma's system doesn't work in 4 wheel drive).


jeep liberty
1 Maybe this contributes to the great performance I experienced.


chevrolet avalanche
2 I absolutely love this vehicle.


jeep liberty
1 Comfort and Convenience: The interior of the Frontier is well laid out, though fairly plain.


jeep liberty
1 If you aren't looking for alot of bling, and instead, value a function over form, you will like this interior.


jeep liberty
1 All the controls are pretty easy to figure out and intuitive.


jeep liberty
1 The interior is a bit on the smallish side.


jeep liberty
1 This doesn't bother me, because I'm a smallish guy, but I can see where others have commented that they would like to see more headroom, etc.


jeep liberty
1 One little complaint about the interior plastics is that it does scratch easily (soft plastic dash materials).


jeep liberty
1 Other than that, everything is tastefully designed and all the buttons/controls are where you think they should be (the layout of the various buttons & knobs are better than my Tacoma).

jeep liberty
2 Price- Better value over Tacoma, the tac. is overpriced!

1 Luckily all of those things have been under warranty.

2 I bought my Frontier used and although it does not have the same resale value of the Tacoma, I feel I got a great truck for what I paid.2)


jeep liberty
1 The Frontier has great power, loaded or unloaded.


jeep liberty
2 Has a great cabin, very quiet smooth ride.


jeep liberty
1 Absorbs bumps very well.


jeep liberty
1 Handles nicely, however turning radius is very bad, use caution on uturns!

1 Sometimes the gears on the automatic shift weird.

1 Interior -- This truck has better visibility than the tacoma.


jeep liberty
2 windshield is much larger and can see more.


jeep liberty
2 Comfortable front seats, I have a crew cab, and the back seats could use a few extra inches of legroom but its enough for kids.


jeep liberty
1 Steering wheel is thick providing nice truck like feeling and grip of the wheel.


jeep liberty
1 Center console has clean simple design that looks very good.


jeep liberty
1 lots of room inside for cd's, pens, change, 2 glove boxes, 8 cup holders, passenger seat folds flat.


jeep liberty
2 However some parts of the door panels looks like cheap plastic but if you take care of your tuck you'll be fine.


jeep liberty
1 Back seats fold up and down, when seats folded down you can hear wind noise however.4)


jeep liberty
1 Exterior- Utilitrack system is great!


jeep liberty
1 very handy when loading things, you have a lot of options to tie down and secure your cargo.

2 The rear door of the bed is very solid nice and heavy door unlike tacoma, feels flimsy and small.

2 Pros: Ride, Quality of Assembly, Value, Powertrain, Quiet Interior, Versatility/Features, 4 Wheel Drive, Exterior Design/LooksCons: Squeaky BrakesDriving Experience: I am very impressed with the driving experience of the Frontier.


jeep liberty
2 The ride is very smooth and comfortable.


jeep liberty
2 It reminds me of the 1st generation Toyota Tundra (which I have owned), except it handles much better and more crisply.


jeep liberty
2 This is still a truck, so the ride and handling aren't going to be comparable to a good sedan or sports car, but compared to other trucks, this version of the Frontier (the LE trim) is excellent.


jeep liberty
2 The steering is tight and accurate at all speeds (unlike my Toyota Tacoma, another truck I've owned, whose steering was a little skittish at highway speed with a headwind).


acura mdx
1 This customer did not provide a text review.


jeep liberty
1 There are no suspension noises and everything feels solid and built to last (the fully boxed frame is a positive contributing factor, I'm sure).


jeep liberty
2 The interior is also exceptionally quiet (again, comparable to my Toyota Tundra and better than my Toyota Tacoma).


jeep liberty
2 It makes the Frontier feel more like a luxury vehicle.


jeep liberty
2 I've not take my Frontier off road, but have had the chance to use it during the winter when we had some heavy snow, ice & freezing rain.


jeep liberty
1 I can say definitively that the Frontier's 4 wheel drive system works flawlessly.


jeep liberty
1 It felt very sure-footed, I never had a loss of traction and I know that I would've slid off the road or gotten stuck without it.


jeep liberty
1 Having said that, you still have to keep in mind that even the best 4 wheel drive system won't help you stop any sooner, so you still have to drive cautiously.


jeep liberty
1 Also the Frontier is unique in that it has a 4 wheel electronic Limited Slip System that works even in 4 wheel drive (the Tacoma's system doesn't work in 4 wheel drive).


jeep liberty
1 Maybe this contributes to the great performance I experienced.Comfort and Convenience: The interior of the Frontier is well laid out, though fairly plain.


jeep liberty
1 If you aren't looking for alot of bling, and instead, value a function over form, you will like this interior.


ram 1500-quad-cab
1 I've driven them all, Infinity, Lexus, GM, R. Rover and hands down, the Escalade topped the list.


jeep liberty
1 All the controls are pretty easy to figure out and intuitive.


jeep liberty
1 The interior is a bit on the smallish side.


jeep liberty
1 This doesn't bother me, because I'm a smallish guy, but I can see where others have commented that they would like to see more headroom, etc.


jeep liberty
1 One little complaint about the interior plastics is that it does scratch easily (soft plastic dash materials).


jeep liberty
1 Other than that, everything is tastefully designed and all the buttons/controls are where you think they should be (the layout of the various buttons & knobs are better than my Tacoma).


jeep liberty
2 On the exterior, as others have mentioned, the Utili-Track system in the bed is excellent and very versatile.


jeep liberty
1 I also like that the sliding tie-downs are made of aluminum, instead of the plastic that my Tacoma had.


jeep liberty
1 Having a factory sprayed in bedliner is a real plus as well.


jeep liberty
2 I also bought the optional bed extender system and that has worked out great as well.


jeep liberty
1 The roof rack not only looks good, but is very functional.


ram 1500-quad-cab
2 I never had any problems with it.


jeep liberty
1 Overall, the engineers obviously put alot of thought and innovation into designing thoughtful, helpful features and it shows.Overall Comments: I have owned both a 2007 Toyota Tacoma (Crew Cab, 4WD, Automatic Trans, TRD Off-Road) and a 2008 Nissan Frontier (Crew Cab, 4WD, Automatic Trans, LE with all available options, including the long bed).


jeep liberty
1 I also owned a 2002 Toyota Tundra (Extended Cab, 4WD, Automatic Trans).


jeep liberty
1 I have already posted an opinion on the Tacoma previously and here is my opinion on the Frontier.


jeep liberty
1 Overall, this is an excellent truck.


jeep liberty
1 For the money (and you can get some great deals right now), you won't find a better deal when you compare the standard features and options that you can get.


jeep liberty
1 Prior to getting my Frontier, I have owned three Toyota Trucks and loved all of them, so I wasn't too sure about the Frontier.


jeep liberty
1 But now, after driving the Frontier for about 1.5 years, I am truly puzzled why this truck is not more popular.


jeep liberty
2 Having heaped on tons of positive praise on the Nissan Frontier (well deserved, I might add), I do have to address a weakness on my particular truck.


jeep liberty
2 I have had to take it in to the dealership at around 11K miles for brakes that were squeaking & squealing excessively.


ram 1500-quad-cab
1 The only time it was EVER in the shop was when I took it in for routine service -- and it wasn't rediculously expensive when I did.It has all the power I would ever need to tow or get out of trouble on the road.


jeep liberty
1 It began at around 10K and consistently got worse.


jeep liberty
1 It didn't matter if it was the beginning of the day or if I had been driving it for a while, the brake noise was consistently there.


jeep liberty
2 The dealership told me this had been a problem with a number of their Frontiers and replaced the front discs and calipers...the whole works.


jeep liberty
2 Well, now I have almost 20K miles on my Frontier and I am again beginning to hear the squeaking/squealing noises.


jeep liberty
2 Looks like whatever they did the first time didn't do the trick so I am anticipating another trip to the dealership.


jeep liberty
2 A little disappointment, compared to an otherwise stellar ownership experience.


jeep liberty
2 Still, I don't know if this only occurred in a small batch of their trucks and I just happened to be one of the 'lucky' ones, or if it is a widespread problem.


jeep liberty
2 Consumer Reports reliability scores didn't seem to show a huge number of people having brakes problems for the 2008 Frontier, so who knows.


jeep liberty
2 In any case, I would still give my high recommendation for this truck and urge you to check it out, if you're looking for a mid-size truck.


jeep liberty
1 I'd also, of course, highly recommend you shop the Toyota Tacoma as well, since that's another truck that I feel has a well-deserved reputation for excellence.

1 If you buy this truck and live where roads are salted or they use anti-skid, buy running boards before the first winter.

jeep wrangler
1 there are no outside heated mirrors, and the truck driveline howls until it is warmed up.


jeep wrangler
1 It takes a long time for the cab heater to heat the inside of the truck and it is also not adequate for arctic temperatures.

2 It was a standard off the lot crew cab long bed S model, drove it for 100K miles, almost no problems, absolutely loved it, so I sold it for $12.5K and bought another one in 2011!

1 Purely a dream to drive!


jeep wrangler
1 Unless you need to haul something over 1000LB or tow something over 6000LB there isn't a better pickup on the market, including the Toyota Tacoma!


jeep wrangler
2 Smooth, quiet, incredibly powerfull V6 engine (much more lively than the Tacoma), got average 17MPG with the 2007, getting 19MPG with the 2011 (think it's because I've got nitrogen in my tires this time).


jeep wrangler
1 Highly recommend the crew cab and 6" long bed for maximum functionality; I routinely haul 4 people (contrary to CR it is much roomier in back than the Tacoma), run a small furniture resale biz, and haul bikes, kayaks, etc. (the bed track tie down system is awesome when you really use it for hauling things and the extra foot really comes in handy)!


jeep wrangler
2 The only negatives are both vehicles needed new rear struts within the first 20K miles, but Nissan replaced them no problem in warranty, the interior is fairly spartan but come on it's a pickup truck, and it has a huge turning radius, which makes it difficult to do u-turns without having to stop and back up to complete the turn or drive up over the curb!


jeep wrangler
2 This truck does everything: Tows, carries 5 people, I can fill the bed with anything and this truck has a lot of power and gets decent gas mileage.


jeep wrangler
1 Really like this truck overall.


jeep wrangler
1 The ONLY issues I have had is with the worse than expected gas mileage and the XM radio display.


jeep wrangler
1 It will only display 8 total characters of the song name, artist name or station.


jeep wrangler
1 But if I start the vehicle, turn it off and wait a few seconds and restart it the display will show all available characters of the display.

jeep wrangler
2 I purchased an XE model (the 4-cylinder version) in August of 2005, with a bedliner and the Popular package including the sliding rear window, tinted windows, AC, and upgraded stereo.


jeep wrangler
1 The release of the 2005 model year is a milestone for this series of vehicles.


jeep wrangler
1 Here's why...Let's start with the frame.


jeep wrangler
1 This is the toughest frame made for a truck in this size.


bmw 3-series
1 The cargo space is large, the navigation system is easy to use, and the adaptive cruise control and blind spot assist are great features.


volkswagen jetta
2 I felt that for the money and reliability the Acura RDX was the way to go.Car is very good looking - we get lots of compliments.


jeep wrangler
1 It is a "junior" version of the same frame used by the Frontiers cousin,the full-size Titan, and it is a huge improvement over the very antiquated frame used by Nissan trucks from 1986.5 through 2004.


jeep wrangler
1 While that old frame was certainly more car-like, this frame means business.


jeep wrangler
2 It helps provide increased payload and towing capability over previous models, especially when coupled with the 6 cylinder engine.You get your choice of two different engines within the Frontier line.


jeep wrangler
1 The 4 cylinder is a tried and true 2.5 liter 155 Horsepower engine that has been used for years in Nissan Altima and Sentra vehicles.


jeep wrangler
2 It is coupled with a 5 speed manual or a 5 speed automatic.


jeep wrangler
1 If you require lots of raw power, the 4 cylinder is not the choice for you.


jeep wrangler
1 It could certainly be described as "gutless" in hard accelerating and has little power to spare for towing or working with heavy loads.


jeep wrangler
1 On the other hand, you will get good mileage with the 4-banger.


jeep wrangler
2 I have had only a few fills that gave me less than 22 mpg, and also only a few fills that gave me better than 23 mpg.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 I thought i'd be bored after trading in my 07 Corvette Z06 in for this, but after a year, im still loving it and feel as good as i can for trading for this.


jeep wrangler
2 The 21.1 gallon fuel tank means great range of 400+ miles from each tank.


jeep wrangler
2 This really met my expectations well.If you need power however, then you really need to step up to the SE or LE line and get the 6 cylinder.


jeep wrangler
1 The 6 cylinder from Nissan is paired with a 6 speed manual or a 5 speed automatic transmission.


jeep wrangler
2 Note--the 4 wheel drive and crew cab versions of this truck only come with the 6 cylinder, as the 4 cylinder would just not have enough ponies.The King cab version of this truck has swing-out rear doors to aid access to the area behind the seat.


jeep wrangler
1 While there are fold down jump-seats in the rear, it takes a very small person in back, and a very cramped person in front with the front bucket seat slid forward most of the way.


jeep wrangler
1 As a 6'2" driver, the jump seat behind my seat is never used.


jeep wrangler
2 The bucket front seats have a very durable cloth covering, and have good firm support for a comfortable ride.


jeep wrangler
1 These seats will give you all-day comfort.The rest of the interior is average in my XE model.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 Another 100hp would be overkill, but would make this a hands-down keep-forever vehicle for me.If you're on the fence about an escalade vs tahoe/yukon.


jeep wrangler
2 I would love to say better things, but there is a dominating presence of plastic everywhere that may turn off some who want a more refined look and finish.


jeep wrangler
1 The center console gives you a large storage area along with 2 cup holders.


jeep wrangler
1 There are two more swing-out cup holders at the rear base of the center console for use by jump seat passengers.


jeep wrangler
1 Instrumentation is solid and functional with a tach and an assortment of warning lights in an efficient arrangement.


jeep wrangler
1 There is even a warning light for tire pressure!

1 The CD/Radio with 4 speakers is OK, but don't expect thrilling true-sounding audio from this setup.


jeep wrangler
1 The dash also features 2 different "glove box" storage compartments.


jeep wrangler
1 One door swings down, holding the owners manuals.


jeep wrangler
2 The other storage compartment door actually swings up.


jeep wrangler
1 I didn't even know it was there for several months, as it simply looks like a covering for the airbag support system.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 Just give one a try... You'll be sorry you didnt if you dont!


jeep wrangler
1 That airbag system is connected to a seat sensor that turns off the passenger airbag if it does not detect an "adult" level of weight in the passenger seat.


jeep wrangler
1 This is a great safety feature for younger riders.


jeep wrangler
1 Nissan's commitment to safety is also present in standard 4-wheel anti-lock brakes.There are many accessories for the bed of this great truck.


jeep wrangler
1 Nissan really pushes the Utilitrack system allowing easily adjustable anchor points for hauling items.


jeep wrangler
1 I really do not carry cargo often, so I opted for the standard bedliner.


jeep wrangler
1 You can also get a sprayed-on bedliner coating that is color-matched.All in all, this truck has grown up from it's little cousin predecessors."

2 I've had this truck for over 3 years and have been very happy.


jeep wrangler
2 I had a 99 Tacoma before this, but didn't like the Toyota's smaller size, rougher ride, and poor driving position.


jeep wrangler
1 The seats in the Frontier are quite comfortable.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 always get great service as the dealers, very happy with car, but a tiny bit too flashy in our current economic climate.


jeep wrangler
2 Engine is more than adequate - even at a mile high.


jeep wrangler
2 Had a bit of a problem with a mysterious squeak for a while early on, but after several attempts the dealer found the hood was rubbing against some rubber bumpers.Had a peek at the brakes when I replaced the tires last month.


jeep wrangler
1 These things still have 80% life left front AND rear!


jeep wrangler
1 I'm averaging 20-21 mpg combined city/hwy driving with the 4WD V6 Auto.

jeep wrangler
2 However, my rear wheel seals and pinion seal have all failed in the past week.


jeep wrangler
1 My wife has an 09 Xterra off road and has also had both of her rear wheel seals fail.


jeep wrangler
1 Both vehicles were taken care of under warranty, but this tells me there are serious problems with the design of the rear axle.


jeep wrangler
1 These seals should not be failing this early.

jeep wrangler
1 I added sunroof, and soft tonneua is a little cheaply made.

1 Great for towing and carrying lawnmower or motocyle.


jeep wrangler
1 Tailgate is a little heavy, but since redesigned in newer models.

jeep wrangler
2 This is our 5th nissan we have owned.


jeep wrangler
2 Good experiences: It can carry quite a load for its size and handles great.


jeep wrangler
1 It gets a few compliments for being a "nice truck".


jeep wrangler
1 The interior makes sense, but the seats could use more lumbar support.


jeep wrangler
1 Once because a little piece of paper got stuck on an intake sensor, a second time because a crank sensor went out(although It was a quick fix and I knew it was coming),and third because an ignition relay went out.

jeep wrangler
1 Since the accents (OEM) are tan and black and the truck itself is Artic White with side moldings, the additions that I made makes this truck a real head turner.


jeep wrangler
2 I have been offered (numerous times) the purchase of my truck on the spot.

2 The Frontier is a great truck for the money and a decent alternative to the pricier Toyota.


jeep wrangler
1 The Frontier is considered midsized, but that's a stretch.


jeep wrangler
2 The king cab model is particularly small and the rear jump seats are not practical for passengers, which was fine for my needs.


jeep wrangler
2 The driving position is snug, but lends itself to a sportier driving feel.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 Need more cup holders in better position for rear seats.


jeep wrangler
1 Controls are logically placed and uncomplicated -- if not too basic.


jeep wrangler
1 There is nothing fancy and there's a lot of plastic.


jeep wrangler
1 The sound system is adequate but nothing special.


jeep wrangler
1 The exterior styling isn't awe-inspiring and is perhaps growing a little dated, as it has been relatively unchanged since 2005.


jeep wrangler
2 However, the lines are clean and the truck does have a solid and substantial look to it.


jeep wrangler
2 The truck is confident on the road and is easy to drive.


jeep wrangler
1 The suspension is taught like you might expect, but not uncomfortably so.


jeep wrangler
1 The highway ride is very smooth.


jeep wrangler
1 Fuel efficiency is decent for a truck.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 Also would like to see Sat Tv for the rear entertainment system, much like Chrysler has with its mini vans.

1 The truck feels solid and well-constructed, the doors are heavy and the frame is stiff.


jeep wrangler
1 The bedliner is useful and durable.


audi a4
1 Great value.


jeep wrangler
1 The gas mileage is about 17 in my suburban/city driving.


jeep wrangler
2 The V6 felt weak and would lag when I pressed the gas and it would rev high but not deliver.


jeep wrangler
1 It felt like a 4 cylinder.


jeep wrangler
1 Did some research and discovered that Nissan puts a Wide Open Throttle restriction on the engine which apparently cuts power by 33 percent.


jeep wrangler
2 The engine is very powerful and has great grunt and the lag is gone.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 Great car over time with with little to no problems.


jeep wrangler
2 Before the tuner, I almost sold the truck for a Ram because the V6 power was so abysmal.


jeep wrangler
2 So the power is now excellent, the lag is gone (especially with overdrive turned off) and I still get about 17 mpg.


jeep wrangler
2 The stock tires hhydroplaned often, so I bought Firestone Destination A/T and they are excellent.


jeep wrangler
1 Great treadwear.


jeep wrangler
2 Ground clearance seemed much lower than my last Tacoma, and I got stuck in deep snow often because the body hangs low.


jeep wrangler
2 I lifted the truck two inches and it makes a huge difference.


jeep wrangler
2 The truck didnt come with anything to hook up my iPod to, so I installed a kenwood navigation system which is great.


jeep wrangler
1 Stock speakers when adjusted correctly are actually excellent.


jeep wrangler
1 My only complaint is no alarm system or immobilizer came on the vehicle.


jeep wrangler
1 It was added a year later to the value truck package.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 Smooth driving and comfortable seating.

1 THe truck's looks are excellent, especially with the chrome bumper.


jeep wrangler
2 The steering is very well weighted and speed sensitive.


jeep wrangler
1 Ill watch out for this.


jeep wrangler
2 Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this truck.


jeep wrangler
1 It feels a lot more solid than the tacoma and it has substantially more headroom and kneeroom and the headrests are not as obtrusive.


jeep wrangler
2 And it is cheaper than comparably equipped tacomas and nissan seems more willing to negotiate.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 Great family vehicle with dual zones for temperature, audio and indiviudal heated seats.


jeep wrangler
1 The tacoma was a good truck, high clearance and fast, but the Frontier is the better match for me-especially after the superchips tuner and the 2 inch lift kit.


jeep wrangler

jeep wrangler
1 Even though it has jump seats, there is still not enough room for kids.


jeep wrangler
2 Also, if a car seat has to be installed for a baby or toddler, then the front seat is not usable because it has to be pushed forward so far to allow for room of the carseat in the back.

jeep wrangler
2 Seems like everything is fine until the warranty runs out.

land-rover lr2
1 The Juke though comes into its own when the sport mode is selected.


land-rover lr2
2 The car simply comes alive, eager to accelerate, holding the road very well (especially considering its slightly raised body height) and very precise steering.The electric power steering can however make it feel like the there is no feedback and it does feel light, around town that is fine but on on the open road it takes a little getting used to.


land-rover lr2
2 It may also contribute to the slight pull to the right under hard acceleration.


land-rover lr2
2 (Torque steer)91+ fuel (Premium) is recommended in the manual which is disappointing but only to be expected on a car with a turbo.Overall the Juke is great fun and I am delighted to have one."

land-rover range-rover
1 It has style, I will give Nissan that, but interior design has some issues.


land-rover range-rover
1 No arm rest in the middle, which I know you can buy after but you'd give up what little center console space you have.


land-rover range-rover
1 The arm rests on the door are fabric with tiny holes so every time you or your passenger opens the door, it sloughs off any dry skin you may have.


land-rover range-rover
1 It looks dull and faded compared to the rest of the black leather interior.


land-rover range-rover
1 I feel like I am getting DNA samples.

2 I am very neat and clean, no kids, and this bugs me for the $27K I spent.

1 You can't put down the backseat on the passenger side without taking the headrest off so it clears the front seat even with the front being moved forward a little.


land-rover range-rover
1 The first 2 sat 8, but the 3rd is a 7 seater with the walk through.

land-rover range-rover
1 You need to use premium fuel otherwise you risk even less efficient gas mileage and long term damage to the turbo.


land-rover range-rover
1 The AWD versions only have an 11.8 gallon gas tank, so with this and the poor gas mileage expect to be a frequent customer at your favorite gas stations.For the driving enthusiasts, the AWD version is not available in a manual transmission ... only the FWD version.Come on Nissan .... you were sooo close with this one."

land-rover range-rover
1 Although I had to get used to a little initial lag when you hit the pedal - once it kicks in, you are rolling!The three modes - Eco/Normal/Sport let you tailor the driving to the situation.


land-rover range-rover
2 I will confess that I've only tried Eco out of curiosity - the sport mode is lots more fun!Have been through two snows with this so far - 8 and 5 inches' worth, and the Juke was sure-footed in the snow (MUCH better than Hubby's 4WD mid-sized SUV).Style - If you are a driver who wants to blend in with the "crowd" - this is NOT the vehicle for you.


land-rover range-rover
1 Very distinctive styling that draws lots of looks, questions, and compliments.I chose the SL version - auto, AWD (with ALL the options you could want, including Leather, Nav, heated seats etc...) in Electric Blue.Had to wait a while for this particular combo due to the demand for such a newly-introduced vehicle - but it was definately worth the wait.


land-rover range-rover
1 After years of owning nothing but BMW's and Range Rovers if anyone had told me that I would buy a Cadillac I would have laughed at them.


land-rover range-rover
2 While I recognize that my driving style is not conservative, I would have hoped for something closer to 25 mpg.Additional recommendations:Would like to see a few more spots of internal storage in future designs.Heated mirrors and power seats would also be nice future additions to the SL package level.All in all - I love my Juke, would purchase again in a heartbeat."

1 No smallish AWD hatch even comes close.


land-rover range-rover
2 Juke has the best AWD system, ground clearance, horsepower, handling, braking tech including brake-accelerator override, and an excellent list of standard features.Out on the road the steering is sharp and direct, but never darty, with minimal roll in the corners and ample grip.


land-rover range-rover
2 The ride is firm, but not at all harsh.


land-rover range-rover
1 Road noise is there but not half what you'd expect from such a firm suspension.


land-rover range-rover
2 Those accustomed to a sport-tuned suspension might find it downright luxurious due to it's long suspension travel.


land-rover range-rover
1 Can be a bit bouncy at times but those occasions are rare.


land-rover range-rover
1 Strangely, wind noise is low but the side mirrors are huge (bulbous fender lights at work aerodynamically?).


land-rover range-rover
2 Good all around visibility and easy to maneuver in tight places.


land-rover range-rover
2 Short front and rear body overhangs swept upward in shape mean scraping the underbody on ramps, parking blocks, curbs, etc is nearly impossible.The torque vectoring AWD is impressive.


land-rover range-rover
1 Equally so is the I-CON system.


land-rover range-rover
1 It actually works!


land-rover range-rover
2 Each driving mode makes the car feel profoundly different to drive.


land-rover range-rover
1 You'll need to utilize "Eco Mode" to get the sticker MPG, and you can't simply floor the accelerator so the car behaves like in "Normal Mode" and expect to achieve those MPG numbers.


land-rover range-rover
1 The fuel efficiency data stored in the I-CON's computer is extensive and very helpful.


land-rover range-rover
1 Though some of the I-CON instrumentation such as a dual axis g-force meter are comically superfluous, at the same time you can't help but feel flattered that Nissan would take the time to make information that the car's sensors are recording available for the customer to see.


land-rover range-rover
1 Clearly they didn't have to.


land-rover range-rover
2 It's a nice touch and bit of fun for passengers.Cost cutting took place to offer the high tech motor, control computer, and AWD at a low price point.


land-rover range-rover
1 Carpet, headliner, and interior plastics are cheap but not unattractive.


land-rover range-rover
1 Extra mats to protect the carpet (and carpeted OEM mats) are a must.


land-rover range-rover
2 The OEM all-weather mats should do the trick.Reliability remains to be seen as the car is newly released and has a lot of tech.


land-rover range-rover
2 We were no more than 1/4 mi from the dealer when we looked at each other and said this is the one.


land-rover range-rover
1 However, most of Nissan's products have been at least average if not above average in reliability so I am very optimistic.In conclusion, the Juke ticks all the boxes save for tons of cargo room and second row comfort for tall passengers.

1 The overarching impression from the Leaf is that it's a "real car."


land-rover range-rover-evoque
1 All covered under warranty, and a beautiful CTS loner car for the day.


land-rover range-rover
1 When you see a Leaf, you know it; its front and rear are both distinctive enough to distinguish it from similarly shaped hybrids.


land-rover range-rover
1 This is the nature of an electric drivetrain with no conventional transmission and only one "speed."


land-rover range-rover
1 The top speed is electronically limited to 95 mph.


land-rover range-rover
2 This is always a good sign in a car.


land-rover range-rover
1 It reflects low noise levels, stability and confidence, things you don't always get in typical cars, much less in efficient ones.In normal driving, the car's dynamics are agreeable, and this is all most drivers will ever encounter.


land-rover range-rover-evoque
2 Great hwy milage for a big truck, very stable at high speed.


land-rover range-rover
1 If you push the car harder, it corners differently than normal cars do.


land-rover range-rover
2 Best I can tell, it's because the 600-pound battery pack lowers the center of gravity dramatically, even compared with the Chevy Volt.


land-rover range-rover
2 The pack is under the front and rear seats entirely, which positions all that mass low and between the front and rear axles.


land-rover range-rover
2 In a normal car, when you take a sharp turn the body leans and the inside wheels get light, making the outside tires work harder to hold the car on the road.


land-rover range-rover
1 In the Leaf, when the tires begin to lose their grip, they seem to do so in unison.I'm struck by how simple it is, and I don't mean that in a bad way.


land-rover range-rover
2 The car has a battery pack connected through associated electronics to an electric drive motor that powers the front wheels through a few reduction gears and a differential.

1 While I really enjoyed that car for many years it didn't not have all the bells and whistles of a modern day car so I sold it and bought the LEAF.

1 Other than not having any other full electric cars to choose from for styling, this car is everything of what I had hoped for and more.

1 The only disappointment in regards to the interior is the sun visors and the manual seat adjustment, both have an econo-box feel to them and are a reminder that Nissan cut some corners in the interior to deliver the Leaf at a almost reasonable price.

land-rover range-rover-sport
1 I must confess I have lusted for an Audi for quite some time, but after driving a Nissan Altima for ten years and having no issues, I thought I had better give the Nissan Maxima and its Infiniti line a try.To be honest, it was the sticker shock that scared me away from the Audi, BMW and Infiniti in the end.

2 But 2007 Escalade was a bad year to buy, and that is quoting the service guy at my dealer.


land-rover range-rover-sport
2 The dealer has tried to correct this problem (and hasn't) but if I drive with the window rolled down, I can smell it- yuck.Then I noticed the car makes a clunking noise in the front end, (I guess it's the transmission) and it happens when the doors lock around 15 mph.


land-rover range-rover-sport
1 (This is separate from the strut issue below).Recently, there has been a recall on the struts in the front end of this car- and of course my car had a defective strut that would make a horrible noise whenever I went over a bump.


land-rover range-rover-sport
2 That had to be replaced.On too many occasions, when my husband drives my car and I'm in the passenger seat, the airbag "off" light comes on and stays on while we are driving.


land-rover range-rover-sport
2 So he literally has to stop the car, turn the car off and restart the car and that usually makes the light go off- otherwise if we crash the airbag won't deflate.

mitsubishi galant
1 only the chrome on the gear shift when the sun hits it it will blind .


mitsubishi galant
2 The 2007 Escalade is a very safe and nice ride.


mitsubishi galant
2 I have owned 6 Maxima's since I started driving.


mitsubishi galant
1 This one is my favorite.


mitsubishi galant
1 I love the CVT tranny, and most of all the unique exterior design.


mitsubishi galant
1 The fit and finish is spot on, the quality of the interior is as nice as an Infiniti, which I have owned 3 of as well as 2 Lexus'.


mitsubishi galant
1 I have lowered it, put 19" TSW zolder wheels on it, full tint all around.


mitsubishi galant
2 I get complements all the time.


mitsubishi galant
2 I would buy another and when the next model comes out I will most likley buy it.


mitsubishi galant
1 Responsiveness & packed with many options not found in more expensive sports sedans.


mitsubishi galant
1 The gas milage is not very good and that makes it really hard to drive every day when gas price's are at +/- $3.25.


mitsubishi galant
1 This is a great sedan that's fun to drive on all roads especially back roads w/ many curves.


mitsubishi galant
1 nice shape/trim/comfort/speed/reliability

2 worth a second look.


chevrolet corvette
1 performance is great.


mitsubishi galant
1 goes beyond expectations.


mitsubishi galant
1 swicthing to manuel transmission is always fun every time.


mitsubishi galant
1 only drawbacks have been some driver blind spots.


mitsubishi galant
2 the tire size has been a problem if i should need to travel in winter road conditions due to the fact no snow chains or cables can be put on the maxima sport package.


mitsubishi galant
2 other than those two small things it has been absolutley wonderful to drive.


mitsubishi galant
2 This car is comfortable for road trips with the family and fun to drive.


mitsubishi galant
1 Usually on road trips no one volunteers to be the one in the drivers seat.


mitsubishi galant
2 On every trip we have taken in our Maxima we argue over who is going to drive.


mitsubishi galant
1 The paddle shift is a great feature when you want a change from the automatic transmission although it has a totally different feel than a manual with the CVT transmission and takes a bit of getting used to for those of us that prefer a manual transmission.


mitsubishi galant
1 Regardless - it really is a pleasure to drive.


mitsubishi galant
2 Bought the car used, not one problem since and put around 30k on it.


mitsubishi galant
1 Love the interior looks and definitely the exterior, turns heads every time I go around the corner.

mitsubishi galant
1 Bought new and have not had any problems.


cadillac escalade-ext
1 I highly recommend it!


mitsubishi i-miev
1 I upgraded to the escalade due to the head turning styling.


mitsubishi galant
1 Gets great gas mileage for a fast v6, plenty of room inside I 6'2" and fit fine.


mitsubishi galant
1 The car is a joy to drive around town.


mitsubishi galant
1 Maint costs will be high due to oil changes and the OEM tires wear quickly because you tend to zip around.


mitsubishi galant
2 Only compaints are the radio, clime control and heahlights on the base model.


mitsubishi galant
1 bot new 7/09 clunker program.


mitsubishi galant
2 sport and cold weather options were worth it.


mitsubishi galant
1 drivers seat does rock a little when stopping or accerating, dealer could not find anything wrong this time, other than that a good dealer experience.


mitsubishi galant
2 Great Boise sound system and a very quick car.


mitsubishi galant
2 Heated seats and steering wheel work fast.


mitsubishi i-miev
2 Sitting back and thinking of all the things that I like and dislike about this vehicle has been hard.


mitsubishi galant
1 Why did I wait so long


mitsubishi galant
1 My car is the only like it in the area I live in (rural area).


mitsubishi galant
1 It's crimson black and a head turner.


mitsubishi galant
2 It's fast, comfortable and has lots of features.


mitsubishi galant
1 The cons would be no sunglass holder and the heated steering wheel doesn't heat as well (compared to my last Maxima).


mitsubishi galant
1 We recently rented an Infiniti and I have to say, my Maxima was it's twin but much, much nicer and a much lower price.


mitsubishi galant
2 The Infiniti did have some get up and go but the interior in my car is much nicer with the dual moon roofs and leather seats.


mitsubishi galant
2 I also got the two tone color inside - my dash is black and the interior is tan.


mitsubishi galant
1 It's a great look and doesn't get as hot in the summertime.You won't regret buying this car!


mitsubishi galant
1 I know people will tell you it's not a true 4 door sports sedan but living in Chicago where else are you going to find a front wheel drive car to deal with the winters and still a blast to drive.


mitsubishi galant
1 I owned a Infiniti G35 and Mercedes E class but both terrible in the snow.


mitsubishi galant
2 4 wheel drive cars get much worse gas milage and wear the tires much quicker.


mitsubishi galant
1 If you live in the south front wheel drive is no big deal but if you are in the midwest or north go with the Maxima for all around sence!!!


mitsubishi galant
2 Fastest and roomiest car for the money and quality absolutely love it babe!!!


mitsubishi galant
2 As a long time Accord owner I decided to treat myself to a Maxima and I am glad that I did.


mitsubishi galant
2 I bought the S model with the zero percent financing at my local dealer earlier this month.


mitsubishi galant
1 I also looked at the Acura TL and the TSX, but the bottom line is, I do not like what Acura has done to the front grill or the rear of these vehicles.


mitsubishi galant
1 In fact, if I were in the market 4 years ago before the redesign, I would have probably leaned towards the Acura TL.One thing I am still getting used to is Nissan's CVT transmission.


volvo xc90
1 The steering was a little light but it handled well.


mitsubishi i-miev
1 The seats are heavy to remove, but comfortable for a 3rd row.


mitsubishi galant
2 I do miss the feel of upshifts and downshifts.


mitsubishi galant
1 Other than that, this car is a dream to drive.


mitsubishi galant
1 This car corners and handles like a car in a much higher price range and power is not lacking at all.


mitsubishi galant
1 I also love the bluetooth feature for my phone and the car is not lacking in the looks department.In my opinion, I don't think that there is a comparable car handling, performance and reliability-wise in this price range and that is why I chose the Maxima.


mitsubishi galant
2 I LOVE this car for the short six months that I have owned this vehicle.


mitsubishi galant
2 I am considering trading my Maxima for another manufacturer (Toyota or Lexus).


mitsubishi galant
2 I have had HORRIBLE customer service and service with the dealership that I purchased my Maxima from.


mitsubishi galant
2 I do not want to continue taking my Maxima to this dealership and receive this type of treatment.


mitsubishi galant
1 I am NOT impressed with any of the Nissan dealerships and their services.


mitsubishi galant
2 SERVICE is especially important once you have purchased the vehicle to keep it running in excellent condition.


mitsubishi galant
2 I have had mine for 4 months, rides great, looks great.


mitsubishi galant
2 And just one of the best cars I have ever owned.Handles like a dream, and the car really wants to go.


cadillac cts
2 Just fun to drive.


mitsubishi galant
2 This car is fantastic...It amazes me, everyday, and I mean everyday, the compliments I receive, both verbally and visually about this vehicle.

1 I love this car.


mitsubishi galant
2 Would choose this car over the G37, Acura TL and any car in it's class.


mitsubishi lancer
1 Bought brand new dec.


mitsubishi galant
1 But I would recommend the Maxima Premimum model,


mitsubishi galant
1 This car never ceases to amaze me!


mitsubishi galant
2 I love the looks and get constantly complimented on them!


mitsubishi galant
1 I have had several "cool" looking cars but NEVER have I been complimented so much on this car!


mitsubishi galant
1 Don't buy this if your shy!The performance is great the only draw back is the CVT transmission.


mitsubishi galant
1 I've gotten used to it and putting it in sport mode is still fun, but you can tell it definitely doesn't have gears.As far as the quality and the features, this car is top notch.


mitsubishi galant
2 It has the look and feel of Infiniti's BMW's and Lexus.


mitsubishi galant
1 A family member has an Infiniti G37 and I think this car's interior trumps his.I would recommend this car to anyone who can afford it!

mitsubishi galant
1 car has great pick up and awesome styling this car looks just like the infinity g35 and some paople who own those cars wish they bought a maxima because of the price gap $for performance maxima is better than g35


mitsubishi galant
1 Could be better heated steering wheel only stays on fora short time.


mitsubishi lancer
1 Battery went dead a month later. 1 out of the 4 of the wheel hub covers was different.


mitsubishi galant
1 Heated seats a little sparatic.


mitsubishi galant
1 Beautiful styling with luxury appointments.


mitsubishi galant
2 only negatives are a tight backseat for a third passenger and not too roomy trunk.


mitsubishi galant
2 I always loved maximas but the 09 is the best maxima i have seen , i have the 08 as well and with 09 shape, speed and looks and the luxury i dont even want to drive the 08.


mitsubishi galant
1 09 loaded is the way to go


mitsubishi galant
2 THIS CAR IS UNBELIEVABLE!!!! HANDLES GREAT, HAS PLENTY OF POWER, AND THE AGGRESSIVE LOOK IS BETTER LOOKING THAN ANYTHING ON THE ROAD.


audi a4
1 Great value.


mitsubishi galant
1 Too bad it's front wheel drive.


mitsubishi galant
2 Having had the car for over 2 years, I wanted to relate my experience with the car as I am currently considering whether it makes sense to move to a 2009 version.Overall, I have been happy with the car which was actually upgraded from a 1998 Maxima.


mitsubishi lancer
2 one spark plug went bad after 6 months.


mitsubishi galant
2 The fact that I am even considering the Maxima shows that my overall experience with Nissan has been good (as long as you can avoid the dealer experience).The 2007 Maxima is roomy, powerful enough for me, excellent braking, comfortable seating (back seat is limo quality or so I have been told), CVT transmission is fine and Bose sounds good to me.


mitsubishi galant
1 I even like the quad exhaust and the engine sound.


mitsubishi galant
1 From the inside cabin, the only way you know that the engine is on is by looking at the tach.The car does have a poor turning radius.


mitsubishi galant
1 This is not a Prius!


mitsubishi galant
2 The interior has some flaws for a flagship car - the steering wheel is from the Nissan parts bin and is the same as the Frontier.


mitsubishi galant
2 I think the biggest issue with the Maxima is the relatively high depreciation as compared to the other Japanese manufacturers.


mitsubishi galant
1 I think that Infiniti suffers from the same problem when compared to Lexus and Acura.


mitsubishi galant
1 2004-2008 styles do not feel as crowded.


mitsubishi lancer
1 the back window pops open when you close the hatch and cadillac can't seem to fix it after several tries...and this is supposed to be GM's luxury brand and their flagship division.


mitsubishi galant
1 Awesome car though...for the money it is as good as more expensive cars like BMW or Acura.


mitsubishi galant
2 It is more of a sport car than Honda/Toyota.


mitsubishi galant
1 I own three Muranos ('03, '05) and now a 2012.


mitsubishi galant
1 The 2003 bas 168K on it and has been trouble free for 9 years of ownership.


mitsubishi galant
2 I am selling the '03 to my nephew who is 17 and about to head to college knowing it has many good miles left.The 2003 is an excellent vehilce and fun to drive but the 2012 takes up up another couple of notches.


mitsubishi galant
2 The '12 rides better, handles better and seems a bit more sophisticated.


mitsubishi galant
2 Though the Murano's are on the higher end of the price scale for their class, I now understand the value in owning one for long term since owning three and the first one is still running very well and has had zero mechanical issues in 9 years.I highly recommned the Murano and will likely purchase another one in the future."

mitsubishi galant
2 Superbly screwed together, interior is easily as nice as the last 4 Lexus we've owned.


mitsubishi galant
2 We went with the Murano in lieu of the RX for its sportiness, though it's no a sports car - but it sure handles well, for its features, the Nav system is very well thought out with voice commands that actually work, the bluetooth that works very well, and it's luxury - looks and feels like an Infiniti inside.We traded in our 05 RX and couldn't be happier.


mitsubishi galant
2 We did opt for the LE, and the only thing missing is the rear seat entertainment system - which we didn't need.


mitsubishi galant
2 So far, after over a year of living with the Murano, we feel we made the right decision.


mitsubishi lancer
1 when one pays over $70,000, these things should not be happening."


mitsubishi galant
2 We're seeing an overall average of just under 21 MPG, and have seen as high as 25 on the open road.


mitsubishi galant
2 Service has been considerably less expensive than that of the RX's we have had.


mitsubishi galant

mitsubishi galant
2 It is an amazing car handling wise.


mitsubishi galant
1 It was between this car and an Audi Q5 or A4.


mitsubishi galant
1 The Audi's out-performed the Murano LE especially considering Supeer-Charged Turbo 4 cylinder in the AWD Q va the V6 front wheel drive Murano LE.

2 Outside of that the Murano is a luxurious 5 passenger SUV.


mitsubishi galant
2 I have had 3 Altimas before this vehicle and my wife still drives the 2005 SL 3.5 V6!

1 Me, being a car collector with names like Ferrari, Mercedes, Lamborgini, and Porsche just want to warn you before buying this vehicle.

1 The all weather floor and cargo mats & cover were nice as well as the mud guards and side mouldings, bumper applique, and all the protection accessories.The fuel economy was also very good compared to the others with it's valve management system of shutting down 2-3 valves when not needed.

mitsubishi galant
1 Style is subjective so I won't go there.


mitsubishi galant
1 I would not have considered the previous generation Murano.

1 I started a lease on an 09 SL AWD in Sept 2008.


mitsubishi galant
1 After driving an 03 Acura TL for 6 years I really wanted something with AWD due to the snowy winters in Nebraska, and the TL just didnt handle snow very well nor did it have the cargo room.


mitsubishi galant
1 I did not get any options on the SL.


mitsubishi galant
1 I chose the SL over the base level S because it came with fog lights, steering wheel radio controls, and power driver seat.


mitsubishi galant
1 Sticker was $31,300.


mitsubishi lancer
1 Mine is Blue chip, a fairly rare color, most being black, tri-coat white, or silver/gold.


mitsubishi galant
1 There are a few complaints I have.


mitsubishi galant
1 I came to realize heated side mirrors are very useful although I do not have them on the Murano I did on my TL.


mitsubishi galant
1 The side mirrors are large and I have a lot of trouble seeing out of them even when it rains, but most of all when its snowing and become ice covered.


mitsubishi galant
1 The heated mirrors are only offered with the tech package which I think on a vehicle at this price they should be standard.


mitsubishi galant
2 Also, when I have the climate control setting to feet only, there is a lot of air that comes out of the windshield defroster vents and dash vents.


mitsubishi galant
2 I addressed this to the dealership and Nissan's customer care and the conclusion they came up with was that the floor vents were too small to handle all of the air and it has to send it through the other vents at the same time.


mitsubishi galant
2 It just causes a problem when I have the heat on because the warm air comes right up the windshield and into my eyes and will tend to make my eyes dry out while I am driving.


mitsubishi galant
1 Putting down the visor helps a little but I was pretty upset the vehicle does this but have come to just deal with it.


mitsubishi galant
1 A couple of other features I think should be standard for this price range are a power passenger seat, satellite radio, and the intelligent key system.


mitsubishi lancer
1 I've had numerous people comment on it.


mitsubishi galant
2 I think the sporty styling and the large dual exhaust really add to the overall experience.


mitsubishi galant
2 It has some great power, even faster than my TL was.


mitsubishi galant
2 I think that surprises some when you take off from a red light and leave them far behind.


mitsubishi galant
1 So, overall I think the vehicle is a great choice.


mitsubishi galant
2 Since I am leasing I am hoping for some changes in the next couple years and would consider trading for another new one."


mitsubishi galant
2 We tested several cars before we settled on the Murano...we think if far exceeds anything we drove at Ford, Buick, Chevy and Toyota.


mitsubishi galant
2 It is very stylish...has excellent response, well balanced, very quiet at high speeds and is just comfortable and fun to drive.


mitsubishi galant
1 The technology installed is excellently installed and its a lot of fun and all the functions are useful.

1 I think Nissan should offer a better extended bumper to bumper warranty though and it should have just a little better visibility in the rear.

2 That w/22" wheels makes it stand out amoungst all other suv's.

1 The CVT tranny is excellent and also quiet...you actually need to mind the speedometer because its so quiet, its easy to find yourself cruzing at high speeds by mistake.

1 I had every intention of getting the 2009 Lexus RX350, until I did some research on the internet.


mitsubishi galant
2 The Nissan Murano seemed to get rave reviews; so, I decided to check one out at the local dealership.


mitsubishi galant
2 Well, one look at a platinum LE on the lot, with it's 20" platinum colored wheels convinced me to check into it further...but a short drive convinced me that this was the car for me !! I quickly ran home to check out the invoice for this fully loaded car...then turned around to get it at slightly over invoice.


mitsubishi galant
2 I cannot tell you how happy I am with this vehicle.First, it is the sharpest looking SUV/CUV on the planet.


mitsubishi galant
1 Secondly, it rides like a dream...is as plush as the Lexus, quiet as the Lexus, but handles better...and seems to accelerate smoother (due to the highly refined CVT).


mitsubishi galant
2 It does such a great job at isolating you from the world around you (which, for a CUV, has always seemed to be the domain of the Lexus RX's) that I find myself just enjoying the pleasure of a relaxing drive.Another factor in my purchase was the crash test results...the five star rating that the Murano got gives me extreme confidence when transporting my family.In short, I think that you can tell that I love this vehicle.


mitsubishi galant
1 I cannot give it any higher recommendation.


mitsubishi lancer
1 Yes, its expensive, new at $68k plus tax, but well worth it.

mitsubishi galant
1 One note; I would have liked the front passenger seat to match the driver side (re power adjustment controls).COMFORT:This is the real reason I bought this car!!!

1 I started looking at Murano since it was introduced, but an interior didn't look appealing.


mitsubishi galant
1 I was on the market for SUV when the new model appeared in 2009.


mitsubishi galant
1 Did test drives of BMV, Lexus, Infinity but liked Murano LE better for its exterior design, interior comfort and smooth driving.

mitsubishi galant
1 None of it is engine related.


mitsubishi lancer
2 I've either owned many of the SUV's you would compare to this vehicle or have driven friends for enough time to get a good feel of the other SUV's .

mitsubishi galant
2 I have had replaced 2- steering column motors, my bluetooth, my CD player, 2- brake switches, 1 module for the brake switch, 2 modules controlling the brake lights.

1 Back about 4 times for the remote start they installed.

mitsubishi galant
1 I am getting rid of it.


mitsubishi galant

2 If you regularly maintain the Escalade and buy good tires when replacement is needed the ride remains smooth and comfortable.


mitsubishi galant
1 I test drove several vehicles including the Lexus RX350, Nissan Pathfinder, Mazda CX-7, and a few others.


mitsubishi galant
1 The Nissan and Lexus were the only two that made the grade.


mitsubishi galant

mitsubishi galant
2 I would like to provide a surprising update to my previous posting on April 5th 2009.


mitsubishi galant
1 This was on a 2009 Murano SL AWD.


mitsubishi galant
2 My feelings quickly changed shortly after posting my last review when I had to address an issue with my engine to Nissan.


mitsubishi galant
1 The engine would make a squealing noise at lower RPM (1,500-2,000).


mitsubishi lancer
1 No bluetooth.


mitsubishi galant
1 This is generally where the RPM was during light acceleration which would be maintaining your cruising speed in normal traffic.


mitsubishi galant
1 I dealt with two different Nissan dealers in my city as well as Nissan Consumer Affairs, all of which said the noise was normal and was the hydraulics in the CVT engine.


mitsubishi galant
1 Before I was told this, the service manager of a Nissan dealer heard the noise and agreed with me it was not normal.


mitsubishi galant
1 However because of the reason he was provided by the Nissan tech people, he sided with them and I was left to deal with the noise.


mitsubishi galant
1 I however have found several postings on various websites where I was clearly not the only person to be dealing with this issue.


mitsubishi galant
2 I also found the consumer affairs people at Nissan to be very unkind and could care less about the quality of the vehicles with their name on it.


mitsubishi galant
2 My gas gauge had been reading incorrectly, not showing full after filling the tank, at one point it even read empty and the trip computer was flashing low tank however it said I had 107 miles to empty.


mitsubishi galant
2 I addressed this to the dealer who said they checked the vehicles computer system and it was not showing any issues with the car.


mitsubishi lancer
2 2. Because of the ventilated seats the leather is prone to very small tears between holes over time.


mitsubishi galant
2 I expressed my frustrations with him and the way Nissan handles their service and issues with vehicles, I told him they do not stand by their products.


mitsubishi galant
2 So, that same day I entered the dealership of another auto maker and was able to trade that thing (Murano) after 22 months of a 39 month lease I was actually not upside down and even traded for more than my payoff.


mitsubishi galant
1 So long Nissan.


mitsubishi galant
2 I will never purchase a product from you again and will not recommend your products and will tell everyone I can about my experience with you ."

mitsubishi galant
2 I love the way the car handles, and feels.


mitsubishi galant
1 But...the blind spots are actually dangerous.


mitsubishi galant
2 Would recommend getting a back up camera.


mitsubishi lancer
1 Navigation is average, but with IPAD's, ONSTAR, etc. it's your fault if you get lost.


mitsubishi galant
2 Also, with 27K miles on my 2009, both my head gaskets had to be replaced as well as my trasfer case gasket.


mitsubishi galant
2 The rear window foam from within the door came up with the window, and the fan blower stops blowing randomly.

mitsubishi galant
2 I have had it only for one week, so far it meets my expectations and I am satisfied so I can rate it 5 stars overall.


mitsubishi lancer
1 However, if you want the overall balance of Styling, Performance (a little growl in the exhaust), and comfort the Sclade is a great SUV.


mitsubishi galant
1 The real test is how I will feel about it a year from now.


mitsubishi galant

2 I bought mine in May of 2008, I believe and have loved it since.


mitsubishi galant
1 Nissan got it right.


mitsubishi galant
1 All the features of a high end luxury car in essentially a family-centric crossover.


mitsubishi galant
1 I built mine just the way I wanted with the bells and whistles that tickled me...auto-rear door, heated leather seats, dual-zone climate control, 9 Bose speakers, 6 CD changer, MP3 player, XM radio (not that it matters in Hawaii), auto rear seat release and raise, back up camera, dual zone seat adjustments, Bluetooth (before it was standard), cargo compartments, Xenon headlamps, and more.I almost never know where my keys are.


mitsubishi galant
1 Keyless entry and push button start negate them.


mitsubishi lancer
1 From Soccer Mom's to Hip Hop Moguls, this car reaches many spectrums.


mitsubishi galant
2 Now, if only I could get my house to cooperate...The ride is smooth and comfortable with the shiftless CVT transmission and my comfy leather seats.Here are my issues:1.


mitsubishi galant
1 The infamous crossover window blind spot.


mitsubishi galant
1 All crossovers have this pointless triangular window at the rear.


mitsubishi galant
1 That's where the blind spot is on the passenger side.


mitsubishi galant
1 I can head check and see nothing, but there will be a car there that I don't see and doesn't appear in my mirrors.


mitsubishi galant
2 I don't think it's a Murano problem, so much as it s a crossover problem.2.


mitsubishi galant
1 The mileage.


mitsubishi galant
2 I have never, ever ever ever gotten more than 16 mpg according to the screen in my car.


mitsubishi galant
1 This is below what it is rated.3.

mitsubishi galant
1 Every time it rains, the brakes squeak horrendously.


mitsubishi galant
2 I've had them replaced once, glazed off, and they still do it.


mitsubishi galant
1 I give up.


mitsubishi galant
2 It goes away once the rain stops and after several days of rubbing off the rust on its own, I guess.Even considering its minor list of flaws, all it's comforts and conveniences are extremely difficult to find at its price point and high quality.

1 All of the little extras such as the heated rear seats and wood grain make for an excellent luxury car but without all the extra money.


mitsubishi lancer
2 SEATING IS VERY COMFITABLE.LOTS OF ROOM FRONT AND REAR.ONLY DRAWBACK IS A BAD BLINDSPOT AT THE REAR WHEN LOOKINGTO THE DRIVERS LEFTSIDE.

mitsubishi lancer
2 I've been very impressed with this car.


mitsubishi lancer
2 It is a very comfortable, smooth, and quiet drive.


mitsubishi lancer
1 Makes long trips on the highway very relaxing.


mitsubishi lancer
2 The 3.5 L engine has pleny of power to pass or get up to speed regardless of the incline.


mitsubishi lancer
2 The CVT makes for very smooth riding.


mitsubishi lancer
1 I like that the back seats recline.


mitsubishi lancer
1 One downside is there is limited storage space, however, I knew that when I bought it.


mitsubishi lancer
1 I wanted a smaller, easier to handle SUV and unfortunately that means you don't get a lot of storage space.


mitsubishi lancer
2 Also, the 2009 Type S has the push button start, but not the bluetooth technology, so you still have to get the key out of your pocket.


mitsubishi lancer
1 Love the transmission.


mitsubishi lancer
1 Definitely NOT a truck.


mitsubishi lancer
1 Smooth operator!


mitsubishi lancer
1 I must admit I am a Nissan lover, I love the practicality, dependability of their cars.


mitsubishi lancer
1 I had the Maxima, then went to the Pathfinder, which I liked but was a little boxy.


mitsubishi lancer
1 Then they came out with the Murano.


mitsubishi lancer
2 It is the car for a person who loves organization, its zippy and has more style.


mitsubishi lancer
2 You can sit in the back and still see out of the car.


mitsubishi lancer
1 This is important for those who get claustophobic easily.


acura tsx
1 Very comfortable


mitsubishi lancer
1 This is my third Murano and I have loved them all, however,I wasn't prepared for the looks, compliments, curiousity that this model would entice.


mitsubishi lancer
2 The convertible is a show stopper!


mitsubishi lancer
1 Never once regretted the decision after I drove off the lot.


mitsubishi lancer

1 old woman, I can say I haven't had much of that for a while!


mitsubishi lancer
1 Seriously, the Murano handles beautifully, is pretty good on gas and I can depend on it in the snow!


mitsubishi lancer
1 I do have to go without the space for storage that I had with the Murano, since the trunk holds the hood when its down, but I don't mind too much.


mitsubishi lancer
2 Love this car, and so does everybody I meet!

1 I purchased the Platinum Edition and I must say the car is amazing.


mitsubishi galant

mitsubishi galant
1 If you're considering it, I think it's a good choice.


mitsubishi galant

mitsubishi lancer
2 This is my first NEW car I have purchased and it felt great knowing I was the first one to drive it.


mitsubishi lancer

mitsubishi lancer
1 I most likely will stick with a Murano on my next vehicle.


mitsubishi lancer
1 We leased a 2012 Murano AWD about 3 weeks ago and it has been in the shop for almost the same amount of time.


mitsubishi lancer

honda odyssey
1 Seats are comfortable.


mitsubishi lancer
1 Cargo volume is compromised by external aesthetics ie 'looks'.


mitsubishi lancer
1 Negatives include no coin holder for quarters, gps maps way out of date (at least for TX), and aggravating poor rearward visibility.


mitsubishi lancer
1 Side mirrors have annoying reflections on a sunny day which I attribute to window tinting as no reflections with window down.


mitsubishi lancer
1 It's not sporty but it looks good, it's reliable and it's fucntional.


mitsubishi lancer

mitsubishi lancer
1 The rear seat folds down if you need to transport cargo with surprising ease and much more room than expected.


mitsubishi lancer
2 The Navigator has power fold down seats this doesn't - hard to get the seats out of this SUV.


mitsubishi lancer
1 The safety features were very important when I was still shopping around.


mitsubishi lancer

mitsubishi lancer
1 It looks great but that is where it stops - the Navigator is a better suv for the money.


mitsubishi lancer
1 The reason my "Value", "Quality," and "Overall" ratings are 3's and 4's relate to exterior fit and finish.


mitsubishi lancer
1 If you are considering buying one of these vans be sure to check the finish on the roof.


mitsubishi lancer
1 While watertight, spotwelds are visible on the roof (through the paint), seams in the various sections of roof look a little "forced", and locations where the roof rack brackets attach to the roof (on my van) are down-right sloppy.


mitsubishi lancer
1 There are large amounts of what appears to be the sealant "goop" spread throughout the channel containing the roof brackets, and this entire mess is painted over.


mitsubishi lancer
2 While functionally the roof does it's job, and because of it's out-of-sight it may not be a big deal to some buyers, but it just seems sloppy for a new vehicle.


mitsubishi lancer
1 Hopefully Nissan will address these quality issues.The final issue relates to any new vehicle I suppose, but, be sure that any options that you want on the vehicle are installed at the factory not by the dealer (if possible).In my case, I wanted the rear door glass package and shock-sensors on the van, and was told that they could be added later (they would arrive in "about 2 weeks").


mitsubishi lancer
1 Well, after 3 weeks they are still not available, and it is unclear when they will become available, at what price, and whether they will be as good as the factory installed options (i.e.,whether or not the windows will have defrosters, etc.).All in all I like my NV.


mitsubishi lancer
2 So I have driven the NV on a few test drives and would have to say the lack of the engine inside the vehicle like the Chevrolet and Ford makes it by far the most comfortable van I've ever driven.

mitsubishi lancer

mitsubishi lancer

mitsubishi lancer
2 This is great car, and I would rather push an Escalade that drive a Navigator, but I do think it lacks some of the features that some of the German cars (Mercedes, BMW) do like panoramic roofs or night vsion.


mitsubishi lancer
2 If they can build enough of them this will take the place of the Ford and Chevy models now offered.


mitsubishi lancer
1 They have not left anything out on this Van.Now with eveything there are good and bad points.


mitsubishi lancer

mitsubishi lancer
1 Because the 2013 Pathfinder is a new model we used the recently completed Infinity JX35 crash test results for safety (the cars are very similar in design and are made on the same assembly line in TN).


mitsubishi lancer
2 The vehicles that made it through the third-row room filter were the GM (Traverse, Acadia, Enclave family of vehicles), the Toyota Highlander (borderline, headroom in 3rd row), the Honda Pilot, and the Nissan Pathfinder.

mitsubishi lancer
1 It was good with its blind-spot monitoring feature and navigation (a very small but usable 5.8" screen) for the same price as the Pathfinder SL, but the handling was kinda rough and the gas mileage is not good as what other consumers are complaining about.


mitsubishi lancer
2 Plus, the CX-9 also has long doors that could pose a problem in tight parking spaces.We had the eye on the Pilot but thought that the design was too boxy and may have a new design soon after we buy it.


mitsubishi lancer
2 The Highlander surely will have a new design by early 2014 but we cannot wait for it to come out to test drive for comparison with the other SUVs available now.


mitsubishi lancer
2 And with the Toyota name, it just means more money for the same features as the Pathfinder.The Pathfinder has a smooth ride, a good mpg with its CVT transmission, easy access third row seat and the panoramic moonroof extra feature that works well with the kids in the back.

mitsubishi lancer
1 The reason my "Value", "Quality," and "Overall" ratings are 3's and 4's relate to exterior fit and finish.


mitsubishi outlander
1 And Navigator had smoother ride on the bumps and cracks.


mitsubishi lancer
1 If you are considering buying one of these vans be sure to check the finish on the roof.


mitsubishi lancer
1 While watertight, spotwelds are visible on the roof (through the paint), seams in the various sections of roof look a little "forced", and locations where the roof rack brackets attach to the roof (on my van) are down-right sloppy.


mitsubishi lancer
1 There are large amounts of what appears to be the sealant "goop" spread throughout the channel containing the roof brackets, and this entire mess is painted over.


mitsubishi lancer
2 While functionally the roof does it's job, and because of it's out-of-sight it may not be a big deal to some buyers, but it just seems sloppy for a new vehicle.


mitsubishi lancer
1 Hopefully Nissan will address these quality issues.The final issue relates to any new vehicle I suppose, but, be sure that any options that you want on the vehicle are installed at the factory not by the dealer (if possible).In my case, I wanted the rear door glass package and shock-sensors on the van, and was told that they could be added later (they would arrive in "about 2 weeks").


mitsubishi lancer
1 Well, after 3 weeks they are still not available, and it is unclear when they will become available, at what price, and whether they will be as good as the factory installed options (i.e.,whether or not the windows will have defrosters, etc.).All in all I like my NV.


mitsubishi lancer
2 So I have driven the NV on a few test drives and would have to say the lack of the engine inside the vehicle like the Chevrolet and Ford makes it by far the most comfortable van I've ever driven.

2 Nissan have done a great job making sure of a convenient, comfortable and smart work truck with their amazing back doors and side sliding door.


mitsubishi lancer
1 If Chevy and Ford don't wake up the NV is going to kick their butt.


mitsubishi lancer
1 There is no comparison in the boxes and comfort of the Nissan to the Chevy.

2 Our family travels a lot and before purchasing this vehicle we use to rent vans every few months.


mitsubishi lancer
1 From driving every single kind of van you can think of out there to driving a friends' Nissan Quest, I truly loved the Quest.


mitsubishi lancer
1 Our family owns two "name brand" cars and being in the market for a new large vehicle, this by far was our BEST vehicle purchase.Also, friendly dealership installed extra TV's in the headrests so people riding in the second/third row seats can watch different movies, play music, play video games etc.


mitsubishi lancer

2 We literally shopped at all the minivans and settled with the Quest.


mitsubishi lancer
2 My wife and I only wanted a basic model minivan just to last until our oldest heads out to college in 5 years.


mitsubishi lancer
1 The Quest's, by far, had the best value of any of the basic model minivans.


mitsubishi outlander
2 It has been reliable so far and it is comfortable to drive, but the inside has so much plastic in it.


mitsubishi lancer
1 The interior was to die for as none of the others had a faux wood trim inside along with leather sidewalls inside.


mitsubishi lancer
1 It also has chrome door handles and chrome exterior trimming.


mitsubishi lancer
1 That's something you find on most fully loaded packages.


mitsubishi lancer
1 The drive is superb!

mitsubishi lancer
1 Being suburban addict for more than 11 years, my wife decided to try QUEST, and there are no regrets.


mitsubishi lancer
1 Until you sit inside and drive, you can't imagine how big the interior available room is.

2 If cadillac put in real wood and less plastic, then the escalade would be the best suv on the road.

mitsubishi lancer
1 Every person feels he/she is special.


mitsubishi lancer
1 The aboslutely wonderful Nissan Engine power as usual will never disappoint or hesitate when you need power.


mitsubishi lancer
1 It doesn't think like others; you demand and you got it; It is a NISSAN not Hon....


mitsubishi lancer
1 I thought we made a bad decision on room for cargo, but one trip to COSTCO, I realized I was wrong; the depth of trunk takes care of the width I lost.

mitsubishi lancer
1 We needed to replace our 10+ year old Mazda MPV.


mitsubishi lancer
2 Reliability was #1 (wife is driving 90% of the time - with the kids), followed by comfort and price.My short list was the Sienna, Quest, Sedona and GV.


mitsubishi lancer
1 Once I started researching about reliability, the Quest leapt from #3 to #1.


mitsubishi lancer
2 I was leaning towards the Sedona and GV all throughout the last 6 months --- but the reliability factor kept me on the fence.


mitsubishi lancer
1 The comfort (sooo quiet, plush seating) was another factor.


mitsubishi lancer
1 Having driven a Mazda MPV, I was yearning for some peace and quiet without sacrificing the driving dynamics.


mitsubishi lancer
2 This was where the Quest once again trumped the Sedona and GV.


mitsubishi lancer
2 Somehow, driving the GV and Sedona just didn't feel solid (long term).


mitsubishi lancer
1 Plus, the GV was very quiet but the materials made me doubt it would remain rattle free in 2-3 years.Lastly - was the price.

1 It averaged between 25.6 and 29.7 miles to the gallon.

mitsubishi lancer
1 I was drawn to the unique body style- and the comfort of the interior.


mitsubishi lancer
2 Having purchased a 2012 Sentra the previous year, we were familiar with the CVT transmission.My only "complaints" are A) the driver side door will shut by itself if I don't have it completely opened B)several more USB ports would be great C) the tailgate is a bit heavy- and I don't have power feature on it D)the seats can be a bit uncomfortable after 4 hours of driving.I have not once regretted our purchase -we've owned our new Quest for 3 months.

mitsubishi lancer
1 Fit and finish is much better than that of Accord that I have.

1 I warned her not to buy an Escalade because Cadillac doesn't produce quality cars anymore.

mitsubishi lancer
1 It's too softly sprung.

mitsubishi lancer
1 I was driving a toyota camry for the last 7 years and really loved it.


mitsubishi lancer
2 Since the car started giving some trouble we thought of upgrading to a either a big size SUV or a Mini-Van.


mitsubishi lancer
1 I test drove couple of SUV's and even though I really liked the sporty drive I hate the 3rd row seating arrangement in most of them.


mitsubishi lancer
1 Of the Minivans I test drove I liked Odyssey and Sienna but the 2012 Quest beat them hands down.


mitsubishi lancer
1 There is no comparision to the interiors of the Quest with Sienna or Odyssey.


mitsubishi lancer
1 I observed Nissan borrows a lot of their interior design from the up-market cousin Infinity and Quest is no exception to that.


mitsubishi lancer
1 The interiors look very stylish and gives an expensive feeling and the exteriors looks awesome (Like couple of other reviewers said, the handles are chrome plated with one touch operation) keyless entry is very good and I really liked that fact that you cannot lock the key inside the vehicle.


mitsubishi lancer
1 Drive is very smooth and is pretty sporty.


mitsubishi lancer
2 I also got a very good price on the Quest, which made my decision very easy.

mitsubishi lancer
2 I looked at a lot of minyvans and suv's and the one I really fell in love with was the Nissan Quest!


mitsubishi lancer
1 Why! (1.) It's big! Really,really BIG!


mitsubishi lancer
1 A lot of room for passengers, the driver and a whole bunch of other stuff you want to carry.


mitsubishi lancer
1 It's built on a frame for a suv, not a car frame, so it's higher off the ground.(Sort of like a pickup).(2.)


mitsubishi lancer

1 However, the road noise in this van is pretty bad- and if you sit in the back seat during travel you can't hear conversation or the radio unless it's exceptionally loud.


mitsubishi lancer
2 Also, when I compared to my friends vans we don't have as much storage space (like in the floor) as some other similar type vehicles.

1 Cheap panels dominate the interior.

2 I also enjoy the I-pod hook-up and option for Sirius satellite radio.Thus far the Rogue drives smoothly and can accelerate well if on a flat/even surface (not so much traveling uphill.)Cons:*


mitsubishi lancer
1 Initial turnover/start-up rev's high.

1 A little unnerving, but the dealership advised this is normal* Road noise is also a little loud.. but the sound system compensates this if you like to listen to music loudly.*

chevrolet cruze
1 This customer did not provide a text review. 2 people out of 5 found this review helpful


mitsubishi lancer
1 Beware if you are driving this vehicle in roads or areas where you may have patchy snow- I have found that the AWD turns itself off when you hit a certain speed, pretty much between 35-40mph.. Have discussed this with other Rogue owners- so it is not a glitch in just my car.


mitsubishi lancer
1 RUDE AWAKENING, when you look down and see you are no longer in AWD, driving in a situation where you would like it to be on.


mitsubishi lancer
1 It is a little late w/out AWD on to try and hit your brakes and think you may not slide.


mitsubishi lancer
1 I am an experienced snow/winter driver and would never push the vehicle on snow if I knew it was not in AWD.


mitsubishi lancer
1 So, I find myself acting as if I am driving a 2WD, only because you never know.


mitsubishi lancer
1 I previously had a Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo- very very roomy- but kind of boxy; was originally told the room in this vehicle was comparable to that..Not even close..Because of the rounded body style of the top of the vehicle- you loose a lot of room in back hatch area..Have to use my truck to pick up anything that maybe wider than the dead center of the vehicle.


mitsubishi lancer
2 So as a grocery getter, every day driver- who may not do too much bad weather driving or out of town driving and is very cautious, this would be a great car.

1 I thought that I was definitely going to get a CR-V until I test drove one and was not excited in the least about the vehicle.


mitsubishi outlander
1 Being a long-time Nissan owner I decided that I should give the Rogue a shot.


mitsubishi outlander
1 After test-driving the Rogue, I knew it was the right vehicle for me.


mitsubishi outlander
1 The only real advantage I see the CR-V having over the rogue is the versatility of the rear-seat configurations but the fact that the Rogue rear-seats only fold down (as opposed to to sliding forward and flipping-up as in the CR-V) does not really hinder any of my cargo needs.I have very few complaints about the vehicle.


mitsubishi outlander
1 It is true that the rear-visibility is terrible but it is certainly easy to get used to and should not be a problem for experienced drivers.


mitsubishi outlander
1 The navigation system leaves much to be desired and the Garmin that I had been using in my old car was much better.

1 Sad to see the new design for 2013.


mitsubishi outlander

2 I love the styling and how it handles like a car.


mitsubishi outlander
1 My only criticism of it is the gas mileage.


mitsubishi outlander
1 I had a 2006 Altima before which got 30+ mpg on the highway, so this fluctuating gas mileage is driving me crazy.


mitsubishi outlander
2 If I can get it to hover around 23-25 mpg, I will be happy.


volvo xc90
2 Load them up with equipment and the prices add up quickly.


ram 1500-quad-cab
1 The new extended warranty is NOT complete as was our last extended warranty!


mitsubishi outlander
1 Hopefully, once it is broken in, it will settle down.


mitsubishi outlander
1 I could be wrong, but the sticker says it should range from 21-26 mpg, so I am banking on that.


mitsubishi outlander
1 It is very stylish with rich interior (I got the premium leather pkg).


mitsubishi outlander
1 It feels more like a car than the other crossovers or SUV's I drove.


mitsubishi outlander
2 This one is also AWD, so that will take a little getting used to--especially with the CVT transmission.


mitsubishi outlander
1 I just hope the gas mileage starts normalizing and improving.


mitsubishi outlander
1 my only other comment is that I really miss having the "automatic" headlights that shut off.

chevrolet colorado-extended-cab
1 This car is amazing.


mitsubishi outlander
1 I have a 2013 S model with the Special Edition Package and I considered this model as the best bang for the buck of all models offered.


mitsubishi outlander
2 I paid $21.3KPros: Fun to drive, gas mileage right at the 28mpg highway EPA estimates for AWD version, plenty of room in the back seat, plenty of cargo room(remember, this is a small SUV), very comfortable, composed and relatively quiet ride, the CVT is tuned for optimal mileage if you light foot it, instrumentation and control layout is almost perfect and very intuitive.


mitsubishi outlander
1 Interior materials and quality are excellent.


mitsubishi outlander
1 Adequate acceleration and excellent braking.


mitsubishi outlander
2 Rearview camera is very handy in parking lots.Cons: Ergonomics suffer mainly from the lack of a telescoping wheel.


mitsubishi outlander
1 If you are longer legged and drive with the seat further back, it's a longer reach to the wheel.


mitsubishi outlander
1 Passenger comfort would be aided by the vertical adjustment that is present on the driver's seat.


mitsubishi outlander
1 No armrest in the back.


mitsubishi outlander
1 No bottle holder in the doors and the interior in general could use a couple more cubbyholes for stuff.


mitsubishi outlander
1 The engine drone under heavy acceleration is a bit annoying.

mitsubishi outlander
2 Overall you get plenty of features in this vehicle but compared to the Rav4 and CRV you definitely get better resale value with these two than the Rogue.

2 I bought my 2009 Rogue SL AWD to later find out it is not full time AWD... it simply kicks in when it feels it is needed, which can cause more problems when you lose traction in a corner (I previously owned a car with full time AWD and you can really tell the difference!).


mitsubishi outlander
1 Value - this crossover has it!


mitsubishi outlander
1 All accessories are more than I would imagine for it's price with 6 disc changer, bluetooth system (although hard for the other person to hear), and sunroof.


mitsubishi outlander
2 Reliability - I received an extended 5yr warranty on my trans in the mail after only after 3 months of owning it and have had one electrical recall related to the trans which makes me wary of it's reliability, which so far has not been an issue.


mitsubishi outlander
1 It's shifting points have made me nervous more than once when coming to a stop or trying to pass, and I hear a slipping noise when it switches gears.


ram 1500-quad-cab
1 The only time it was EVER in the shop was when I took it in for routine service -- and it wasn't rediculously expensive when I did.It has all the power I would ever need to tow or get out of trouble on the road.


mitsubishi outlander
1 Styling - nice body style, the interior is well geared toward the driver and the forward folding front seat has helped me alot!


mitsubishi outlander
1 Roof line is a little flimsy, my Pet Barrier isn't as stable because of this.


mitsubishi outlander
1 Comfort - Great if you have a short commute, but an hour or more causes some discomfort in the lower back.


mitsubishi outlander
2 Could use better lumbar support in the seats and a column adjustment rather than just the tilt to bring weight off the shoulders."

mitsubishi outlander
1 gas mileage at highway speeds is great.


mitsubishi outlander
2 i was able to avoid a tree that fell across the road at night in less than two seconds.


mitsubishi outlander
1 narrow roadways in my area are easily navigated.


mitsubishi outlander
1 auto/manual transmission allows me to either relax a bit or have full control over the engine.


ram 1500-quad-cab
2 Probably the only negatives I have is that the ride can be a little rough from time to time, but that is my own fault for putting low profile snow tires on it.


mitsubishi outlander
1 paddle shifters on the steering wheel are a fun bonus.


mitsubishi outlander
1 the bose 6-cd stereo system with ipod jack sounds phenomenal and doesn't have to be cranked to maximum volume to be clearly audible, even at higher speeds with windows open.

2 I love the input for my i-pod and the 6 disc CD changer.


mitsubishi outlander

2 This is the most comfortable vehicle I have ever owned.


mitsubishi outlander
2 I absolutely love the bluetooth and the bose stereo system.


mitsubishi outlander
2 I would have rather had a 6 cylinder but it has good power for a 4. It is a little loud during acceleration but not during normal driving.


mitsubishi outlander
1 There are a few blind spots on passenger side and going around turns it is sometimes hard to see a vehicle due to the panel at side of front window.


mitsubishi outlander
1 The other thing I would change is gas portal located on passenger side- prefer driver side.

2 I bought this car in June of 2012.


mitsubishi outlander
2 Personally I'm not a huge fan of the body style but for the features I was looking for in a crossover vehicle this was the most reasonably priced crossover I could find, then once we talked the dealer down it was a steal.


mitsubishi outlander
1 I was mainly comparing the car between Jeep Compass, Ford Edge, GMC Traverse and Toyota Venza.I haven't had any mechanical or cosmetic issues since I've owned it.


mitsubishi outlander
1 Some of the cons that come to mind are the pick up is pretty awful (but not as awful as the Jeep Compass), even with the "sport" mode activated - I can't notice a difference in pick up between the two.


mitsubishi outlander
1 The CVT is also loud, but honestly you get used to it quick, I don't even notice it now and it doesn't bother me.I wish the navigation system was slightly larger and had more voice controlled options like my husbands 2012 Dodge Ram has.


mitsubishi outlander
1 But over all the navigation has worked extremely well, never mislead me to a wrong location.


ram 1500-quad-cab
1 Its great!


mitsubishi outlander
1 But sometimes (especially when you are merging on between two highways or getting on a highway) it's very hard to tell where/when to turn as if solely relying on the navigation by reading the street/highway it tells you to turn on it doesn't tell you whether or not to get on South or North or East or West, just the highway name appears not which direction.


mitsubishi outlander
2 To me after seeing my husbands navigation in his truck and how detailed it is, I was highly disappointed in mine.The MPG is as advertised, however the fuel tank is smaller than my Audi sedan so on top of losing 10MPG compared to the Audi I feel like I'm constantly having to get gas.


mitsubishi outlander
1 I wish the tank was slightly larger.The car does seem to have a lot of blind spots.One feature that I do love and find myself constantly using are the cameras located on the side view mirrors.


mitsubishi outlander
2 Even though I'm capable of parking the car without them it's always nice to check quickly and easily to double check that I'm centered so no one too close to me dings my car with their door.Also a big thing to me was the leg room in the back seat, after having my Audi which had lousy leg space I wanted something that felt roomier and for a crossover this seems to have ample leg room.


mitsubishi outlander
1 There is also plenty of cargo space in my opinion."


mitsubishi outlander
2 I bought my 2012 Nissan and after three months the paint began to peel on the bumpers.

mitsubishi outlander
1 Nissan consumer affairs has not helped.


mitsubishi outlander
1 On the flip side, the car is cute, offers a great ride and has plenty of power.


mitsubishi outlander
1 The seats fold down easily and it has plenty of storage space.


mitsubishi outlander
1 It does have significant blind spots and nearly impossible to see behind you when backing up.


mitsubishi outlander
2 The rear camera helps.


mitsubishi outlander

1 brings me to Fault#2) The only thing I truly do not like about this car (and seriously, it will be a deal breaker in the next car I purchase), the gas tank is on the right side.


mitsubishi outlander
1 I know it sounds like a silly thing to complain about.


mitsubishi outlander
1 But, as a female, if I have to stop to get gas at night in an unfamiliar part of town- having to walk all the way around the car to pump gas is a bit scary.

2 I was torn between the rogue and ford edge, then when i seen the rogue was about 10g's cheaper i went for it.

2 The only thing i didnt like and took a while to get used to was the cvt trans.

1 I drove a standard for 3 yrs and it really drove me nuts and unless you move the shifter over it does no good to paddle shift cause it changes back.

2 Pros: Fun to drive - easy to park - lots of room inside, especially when back seat is put down flat plus passenger's side seat - good mileage - easy on gas - takes the corners like a sports car - good pick up in traffic - love the heated front seats in the winterCons: No daytime running lights; doors unlock automatically when engine turned off - this could be a safety factor in a dark parking lot at night - lock control on driver's door not illuminated at night - must turn on interior light to lock the doors - this may be a safety factor at night in a dark parking lot" 5 people out of 7 found this review helpful

1 I really love the styling of this vehicle.


mitsubishi outlander
2 The rogue is a fun car to drive, its stylish, gets good mileage, and has nice handling, thats pretty much it for the positives of this car.Unfortunately the negatives far outweigh the positives in my opinion.The trunk space lacks, height,depth,width, so much so it can barely fit in our stroller.


mitsubishi outlander
2 The visibility of this car is so bad I find it to be a safety issue.There is little to no leg room for both passengers in the front and back seats.


mitsubishi outlander
2 If you have or will have a family in the future..avoid this car, there are much better CUVs for less than the Rogue."

2 I traded in my 2007 Nissan Alitma for a 2012 Rogue.

1 The 2009 Rogue is "okay".


mitsubishi outlander
1 I gave this car a comfort and convenience rating of 2.5 because although the design looks good, there are many blind spots and people over 5'4" must duck their head when getting in in order to avoid banging their head on the ceiling.


mitsubishi outlander
1 Or, if you are a woman that wears your hair up, plan to knock your head on the ceiling as well.

1 Lastly, I gave the driving dynamics a 2.5 because the brakes are "squishy" and do not stop immediately as expected.

mitsubishi outlander
2 Car and Driver hated this car, claiming its weak horsepower makes it "not fun to drive."


mitsubishi outlander
1 If twitchy, overly sensitive gas pedals are your definition of "fun to drive," then by all means get a Mazda 3.


mitsubishi outlander
1 There was nothing wrong with the Cruze, but just too small for a guy my height.


mitsubishi outlander
1 If you like middle of the road handling that gives you the ability to gun it when you want to or drive conservatively, then you'll like this Sentra.Exterior:The exterior has a classy, almost luxury-car style.


mitsubishi outlander
2 My SL has a very attractive silver trim around the doors and windows.


mitsubishi outlander
1 The look, as Car and Driver points out, is somewhere between a Versa and an Altima.


mitsubishi outlander
1 This is not a negative point - it looks better than a Versa and not quite as cool as an Altima, but close.


mitsubishi outlander
1 If you get the SR package, you get a rear spoiler that looks pretty nice but serves no practical purpose.


mitsubishi outlander
1 The keyless features are very cool and make sure you never have to take your key out of your pocket.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 Great car over time with with little to no problems.


mitsubishi outlander
1 For me, the car is perfectly sized, being incredibly roomy while still being a compact.Interior - Driver controls:The steering wheel is pretty standard, but nothing to complain about.


mitsubishi outlander
1 I do agree with previous reviewers that the gauges are a little bit dated (digital MPH would have been nice), but the Sentra does have a screen for your odometer, trip calculators, average and current MPG, and even current gas pedal throttle, which shows you what range you should be in for optimum gas efficiency.


mitsubishi outlander
2 The auto lights are convenient but don't be an idiot like me - if your parking lights are on and your headlights are set to auto, then your headlights will be always on.Interior - Technology:I got the Navigation package, which includes a nicely sized screen with GPS navigation.


mitsubishi outlander
1 The screen doubles as a radio/bluetooth/MP3 player controller, so I'm not sure how those would work without it.


mitsubishi outlander
1 Scrolling through the radio is very easy, and the steering wheel has a switch for going up and down preset stations.


mitsubishi outlander
2 I guess this is supposed to replace the Scan function, because as far as I can tell the Sentra with navigation does not have it (in a lot of radios, pressing the Scan button will find the next good station, let you listen to it for a few seconds, and then continue to the next one).


mitsubishi outlander
2 This might just be an error on my part though.You can play your music through Bluetooth, which is a very nice feature since I buy all my music on my phone with Amazon MP3, so it's great to be able to play them all as soon as I enter my car.


mitsubishi outlander
1 Any music app you have will work since the audio is just piped through Bluetooth.


mitsubishi outlander
2 I haven't tried these features but you can play songs on a USB stick or hard drive, which is very cool and I imagine would be great for a road trip with friends.


mitsubishi outlander
1 The default sound system is nice, bassy and clear.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 Smooth driving and comfortable seating.


mitsubishi outlander
1 I do not have the Bose system but I imagine its great.The rear view camera is extremely convenient, especially when backing out of crowded shopping areas.


mitsubishi outlander
1 The guide markers show you approximately how close objects are to you - be aware that these markers are aligned to the ground.


mitsubishi outlander
2 It works very well in low light or no light situations.The GPS navigation I believe is TomTom.


mitsubishi outlander
2 It is pretty accurate and I have no complaints, but it would have been nice if it showed the speed limit for the area.


mitsubishi outlander
1 It has the ability to send texts but only a limited number of canned responses, so no real speech-to-text like that found in Siri or Google Now.


mitsubishi outlander
1 It will read your texts however, which I use all the time.Interior - Space:There is plenty of leg room in the front and the back.


mitsubishi outlander
1 I was able to fit 3 people in the back without any awkward scrunching together.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 Great family vehicle with dual zones for temperature, audio and indiviudal heated seats.

1 I imagine this would make it a good family car.


mitsubishi outlander
2 The wheel feels tight and just sensitive enough to feel like you have a lot of fine control.


mitsubishi outlander
1 Accelerating is smooth and nice.


mitsubishi outlander
2 The car is pretty isolated from the road - I know KBB said it's not as isolated from the road as the Cruze, but my experience was the opposite.


mitsubishi outlander
1 Maybe my model is different from what they tested with.There is no option for changing gears (because there are no "gears" in the Sentra thanks to the continuous variable tranmission).


mitsubishi outlander
1 I certainly don't care about this because I loves me some automatic, but others seem to.The car has an Eco mode, which makes the engine essentially weaker, therefore theoretically using less gas.


mitsubishi outlander
1 I'm not sure if the mode is actually useful.


mitsubishi outlander
1 It may make the engine weaker, but it doesn't make the engine more efficient - it really just forces you to accelerate slower.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 one of the best car ever


mitsubishi outlander
1 If you to turn on the mode that shows you pedal throttle position and try to hit the green range, you will accelerate painfully slowly, potentially annoying the people behind you.


mitsubishi outlander
2 Like I said, where I live the speed limit is 50, so if you live in a place where the limit is lower then you might benefit from this.I've been just a tad disappointed with the MPG of the car - if I really pay attention to accelerating slowly, then I can get 30+ city.


mitsubishi outlander
2 If not, then I will get around 24-26.


mitsubishi outlander
2 Maybe I just need to work on accelerating optimally.


mitsubishi outlander
1 On the highway however, I get 42+ MPG, 45 if traffic is moving along the whole way.


mitsubishi outlander
1 This is much better than expected and I'm pretty darn happy with this.All in all, great car, very minor negatives.

2 I drove this car for a 16- hour road trip after my purchase and was very impressed with the performance.


mitsubishi outlander
2 The first three fill ups averaged over 36 mpg on the road with a fully loaded trunk and backseat.


mitsubishi outlander
1 The Bluetooth, radio, and Tech package are outstanding.


mitsubishi outlander
1 The cars new style, comfort, and looks are superior over most of the competition- even for a six foot tall person.

1 I see why they call it Escalade, it will make you feel like your on top of the world.It's like sitting your lazyboy driving down the highway.


mitsubishi outlander
1 Handling was great, but don't expect great gas mileage or speed response if you gun it.


mitsubishi outlander
1 The CVT transmission is similar to other cars with the same drivetrain like the Prius and does limit performance.


mitsubishi outlander
1 Nissan does give the three different drive modes to compensate.


mitsubishi outlander
1 Mileage will probably average under 30-mpg in town.


mitsubishi outlander
1 I do wish the gas tank was larger for a long trip.

2 The CVT transmission does rev like most others, but is not a problem with a lighter touch.

2 The car is smooth and super efficient.

1 However, remember it's not an Altima even though it looks closely like one and hence is slow to pick up or accelerate.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 So comfortable, so stylish, hands down one of the nicest vehicles on the road!


mitsubishi outlander
2 We found no problems with entering freeways or ramps, however this usually happens from about driving at 40-50mph.


mitsubishi outlander
1 Accelerating from traffic stops though is a little pain.


mitsubishi outlander
1 More so in the ECO mode.


mitsubishi outlander
1 In the 256 miles we drove, we reached about 29.8mpg in combined driving conditions (starting from 26) and expect it to go higher.The interiors are huge and ride is smooth, if not a little stiff but we are upgrading from a 2003 Mitsubishi Galant so hey no complaints on that!The voice recognition is spotty and we are yet to figure out a way to train the system.


mitsubishi outlander
1 The boot space is awesome, rear cam is good.Be mindful of the rear view/blindspots.


mitsubishi outlander
1 The rear (C-pillars I presume) could block out some of the view and the high boot reduces the view (but most new cars are like this).For the money, it is worth it.


mitsubishi outlander
1 Though, 256 is still relatively new.


mitsubishi outlander

mitsubishi outlander
1 So, far, I love my Sentra...the gas mileage is unbelievable...but the front drivers seat is one of the most uncomfortable that I have ever experienced.

1 I traded a 2012 Nissan Altima special edition which was truly was a very decent car.; i.e., good gas mileage, very comfortable, attractive and extremely reliable.


mitsubishi outlander
1 OK, comfort and interior storage isn't comparable, ride is actually the same, maybe a little bit less road noise, handling is more then reasonable, although not conducive to sporting enthusiasts.In summary, if you're looking for a vehicle that demonstrates outstanding gas mileage, more than decent appointments, great appearance coupled with a price point that's extremely competitive, why not take a look?" 4 people out of 4 found this review helpful

mitsubishi outlander

mitsubishi outlander
1 You can't have both, if you want a performance car that will go fast, then you tend to lose the great gas millage.

1 As for the car itself, it has enough power to get you up to 80mph without flooring it.


mitsubishi outlander
2 The CVT transmission does feel different than the last generation (which I miss actually), but this car comes with the Eco/Sport buttons which all make the CVT behave differently.


mitsubishi outlander

1 It is a bit too jumpy in Sport mode, even if you are trying to beat someone off the line when the light turns green.

1 I've also heard people talk about the "moaning" of the CVT at low rpms.


mitsubishi outlander
1 Maybe somewhat, but nothing to take your eyes off the road or think something is wrong with the car.


mitsubishi outlander

1 I had been reading up and interested in the all-new Sentra 2013 online since its oversea version was first introduced as the name of Sylphy, and way before Nissan unveiled it in US.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 The reason being was because I was driving a Sentra 2008, which BTW is a great commute car, and was looking to upgrade to a new commute car with good MPG.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 The inside-out redesign of Sentra 2013 peaked my interest with its new engine, new CVT transmission, and all new interior / exterior.

1 So, when these Sentra hit the dealers around 10/16/2012, I got one of the first few in DFW area.After calling up local Nissan dealers and checking out a very first Sentra 2013 SR available in DFW area, I was however so disappointed.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 The interior of the SR model looks and feels cheaply made.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 The craftmanship, materials and color (charcoal interior) made me feel I rather sit and drive in my old Sentra 2008.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 This first impression was bad enough that made me feel not even like to test drive the car, though I did to sastify the saleman.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 A week later I decided to give it a second chance as another dealer contacted me to check out couple Sentra 2013 they just received.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 I was in love as I cheched out and tested drive the Sentra 2013 SL trim with Navigation package (with Marble gray interior).


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 I really don't know what was going on, but this SL model made the SR one I tried earlier looks like a fake or defective fist batch of Sentra 2013.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 Anyway, below are what I feel about the car after over two months driving it.Exterior:


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 The overall exterior looks very style and seems bigger than the actual size of the car.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 First glance makes you feel it is mid-size sedan.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 The SL trim comes with alloy wheels, fog lights, auto headight, the turn-signal lights on outside mirrors and front / back LED lights make it looks like one of those luxury carsInterior: The SL trim comes with premium cloth and maple wood trim which seems to make a huge difference comparing to that of the SR model I tried, especially in marble gray color.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 Plus, the leather-wrap steering wheel and shift node, soft touch interior, intelligent key, dual-zone temperature that come with the trim combined with the voice activate bluetooth, navigation system, backup camera in the Navigation package make you feel like you are in a much more expensive luxury car.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 The heating vents under front seats come handy in the cold weather for passensers in the back seats.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 The ceiling pad however is made of cheap material that looks and feels like carboard.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 Front seats don't seem to have thick padding to provide comfort for long trip.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 However, the driver seat and the steering wheel adjustments can be adjusted to fit all driver sizes.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 You can also adjust the driver seat to lift UP to sitting position like those in SUVs and for better driving view.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 For the back seats, there is plenty of leg room.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 My small 5'2" wife is able to fit in comfortly between the two boosters on the back seat, and that she and the kids can get in/out easily with the roomy leg room.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 The compartment is kinda small comparing to that of my 2008 Sentra.

2 It comes with emergency release and can be remotely opened with the intelligent key.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 Dashboard looks sporty and control buttons are well laid out(except for the 3 driving mode ones).


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 The stereo on the SL trim comes with 6 speakers provide good audio.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 It also supports MP3 CDs as well as provide USB and AUX ports for additional audio / music source.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 It also can synch and play music from bluetooth support devices.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 The touch screen navigator works and operate awesome comparing to those portable ones available at retail stores.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 The voice activation is not that accurate (could be because of my accent); however, it at least allow you to train/record names for quick phone dial.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 It also comes with other features that I didn't have a chance to play with.Driving: Though come with a new small 1.8L engine, the Sentra 2013 is very responsive in acceleration, smooth and quiet due to the new CVT transmission with higher ratio comparing to my old Sentra 2008.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 Many people (including myself) performed the test drive without aware the availability of the 3 driving modes (Normal, Eco, and Sport buttons on the dashboard, underneath left of the steering wheel) the new Sentra (all trim) supports.


ram 3500-mega-cab
2 I owned three jeeps before this but there is no comparison in all attributes


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 Beside the normal mode, the Sport mode give more throttle and better response making you feel like driving on a V6 or V8 car needing to zip through peak-hour traffic.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 This is overcome the lack of responsive I found on CVT transmission in general, or my old Sentra 2008 in particular.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 In contrast, the ECO mode provide less throttle and automatically turn off AC if the car is being idle, which in turn provide better MPG.Gas mileage: The Sentra 2013 rated for 30/39 (city/highway) MPG.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 However, I believe it is underrated, depend on your commute and driving hobby.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 In my daily city commute to work, I typically get about 34-36MPG.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 If I cruise on highway at around 60Mph and with ECO mode on, I can get up to 44MPG.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 However, I found the MPG drops significantly if driving over 70Mph on ECO mode due to lach of power.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 Switching to Normal mode would give more power to ease push the speed to more than 70Mph and MPG is about 38-40MPG.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 My Sentra 2013 seems to provide best MPG with Exxon regular 87 gasoline.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 I tried other super 93 gasoline from both Exxon, Chevron, and other brands but resulted in lower MPG by surprise.


acura mdx
1 This customer did not provide a text review.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 Another tip I found is that the Sentra provdes better MPG with the first 2-3 gallons out of the full gas tank.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 After that, the MPG starts dropping.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 This also applied to my old Sentra 2008.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 I guess this is because it has something to do with the gas tank is part of the gas system of the car.Reliability: Since I only own this car for over two months, I cannot rate its reliability.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 I'll probably update the review after thowing around 50k miles on it.After all, if you are looking for a good car for typical daily commute, Sentra 2013 may be a perfect one.

2 Mostly, I bought this car for the Nissan name and the gas mileage.So far the car is comfortable and classy, but the gas mileage is no where near what is advertised.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 The tank is small, so you're getting fewer miles in between fill-ups.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 I do a combination of city/highway driving, probably a little more city, but I always use the eco drive mode.

1 This customer did not provide a text review.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 My four tank fill ups so far have averaged 28, 30, 31, and 25 MPG.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 The vehicle I test drove didn't seem to have those issues, but when I brought mine back to the dealership to have it checked, they said that's just the way the car is made."


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 I purchased the SR version and have been driving it for just over 3 months now.There are quite a few things to like about this car.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 The exterior is youthful and aggressive compared to the last generation.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 The technology included in this trim is a good value and very user-friendly and intuitive.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 This includes a 5" nav screen with back up camera, xm radio, bluetooth capabilities, voice command, red backlit steering wheel controls and the USB slot/charger slot in the middle console just to name a few.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 The trunk is huge for a car this size and the interior is surprisingly roomy.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 Unfortunately, this car is all looks and no substance.The biggest con for this car is the grossly underpowered engine.


acura mdx
1 This customer did not provide a text review.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 I expected reduced power for increased gas mileage but it feels like they sacrificed too much for so little return.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 Having driven other Nissans I am very familiar with CVT transmissions but this one is jerky and feels strained under normal acceleration.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 If you find yourself in a situation where you have to hit the gas the underwhelming engine sounds like a glorified golf cart and doesn't accelerate much faster than one either.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 I guess you could overlook the lack of power since the gas mileage is supposed to be great but this leads me to major problem #2.I do the vast majority of my driving going 55mph or less.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 I am only getting 26-27mpg!


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 And this isn't city traffic full of red lights and stops.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 This is decent back roads and some stop signs.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 But as another previous poster stated, the gas mileage diminishes significantly when 70mph and over or when using the cruise control at these speeds (even with eco boost).My family has had at least one Nissan in our driveway for the last 12 years and we have always been very satisfied with their quality and value.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 I still think this car is a respectable choice for long haul daily commuters and older folks who aren't quite ready to drive sedans.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 But I think the majority of drivers will be disappointed with the lack of power from what on the outside looks like a sports car.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 It just plain isn't fun to drive and as soon as it makes financial sense I plan on upgrading to an Altima or Maxima."

2 I purchased the Sentra after owning a 2012 Nissan Frontier.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 I've noticed that the Sentra burns fuel exactly the same way the Frontier did.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 When I filled up the Frontier, the dte (Distance Till Empty) displayed a range of 431 miles which is the same that Sentra displays.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 I drive 138.2 miles round trip to work Mon - Fri. 116.2 miles of my trip is mainly on the interstate.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 The 22 miles that is driven on the secondary road consists of 4 traffic lights with a short distance of about 8 miles to reach work at a speed of 45 to 55 miles per hour depending on traffic.


acura tl
1 I love this car.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 Highway speeds range at 75 miles per hour with cruise control set and air conditioning on.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 The Sentra has an "eco" setting that I use consistently because without the "eco" engaged, the gas mileage is worse.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 If Nissan cannot figure it out, I will trade this car in for a Honda which I know will get me the gas mileage I desire." 4 people out of 5 found this review helpful

2 Nissan has made some changes since the 2012 and previous model years.1

2 I upgraded from my Acura 2004 RSX to the RDX.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 It is really awesome to look at, and very reliable.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 I stayed with Nissan because the transition was easier with having an existing lease already and it was always a comfortable and reliable little car which got me where I needed to go, as well as being affordable.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 Although the gas mileage does seem better (always a plus) and the back/rear is extremely comfortable and roomier, the drivers seat is not comfortable at all.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 It feels like something isn't right and I find myself adjusting everything each time I get in the car.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 It feels like the space between the wheel and the top of your legs is limited and no matter how many ways I adjust the seat and wheel, my legs do not feel comfortable.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 Also, my arms are not relaxed or comfortable either - it feels like I am stretching them it's not because I am too far back.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 I am very disatisied and unhappy with the way this car drives.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 It feels like something is wrong with the car - like it doesn't want to move - like it's stuck in the wrong gear - or almost like the emergency break is on - it jerks - its NOISY which is distracting - it is not easy or pleasant to drive - it feels like you have to work to drive it if that makes sense - not smooth at all.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 This happens when pulling out, stopping at a light or stop sign, turning and even braking.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
1 I am told by the dealer (salesman, sales manager, service manager, and supposedly an outside engineer that looked at the vehicle) that this is "just the way the car is manufactured" and that nothing is wrong with it - that it is the result of the new CVT transmission."

1 Negatives, it is a huge gas guzzler.


mitsubishi outlander-sport
2 I have found that the airbags turn off from time to time when she is in the seat.

2 this truck is great, I used to have a Ford F-150, I dont miss it at all! my Nissan has all the power I've ever needed, looks great, sounds great.


porsche cayenne
2 and since no vehicle ever gets good mileage towing my horses, im not ashamed of the 15 mpg that it gets when the girls are in the back.


porsche cayenne
2 with no load, I get a solid 17.5 to 18.5 mpg, depending on if I pass anyone alot or not.My truck is comfortable, rides nice and handles great too! the factory stereo leaves something to be desired, but I cant complain too much, I didnt opt for the premium system.


porsche cayenne
2 my only regret is that the new body style is about to come out and I owe too much on this one to consider switching to the new model.I cant wait to get my hands on that one, it is really beautiful!

porsche cayenne
2 The truck is very comfortable on long hauls, as we typically drive it to Florida twice a year for our vacations.I don't understand why no other OEM has a sprayed-in bed liner, like the Titan's, but it's a VERY necessary item IMO.But, with gas and the economy the way it is, I've decided to trade the truck....for an '08 loaded Pro-4x4 Titan!

porsche cayenne
1 The extra features available make the truck well worth the loss in power.


porsche cayenne
1 Leather interior with red stitching, back up sensors.Also in this truck is a new type of automatic transmission, that makes shifting easier, a VTS (variable timing transmission).


porsche cayenne
2 You won't feel the vehicle shift through gears in normal driving conditions.Also if you're looking for a new "toy", the titan can be bought new with a nismo exhaust!

2 Sound quality on stereo is lacking.

1 Therefore it's a niche car among niche cars: a sports car, and one that doesn't rely on neck-snapping power for thrills.

1 Subaru's attempt to standardize these pieces across their model range backfires in the BRZ.The exterior was designed by Toyota, their only part in the project.

2 The back seats are useless except for storage purposes, and the car would have been better off designed as a 2-seater from the start.


ram 1500-quad-cab
2 This would have narrowed the doors a bit, although they're much more user-friendly in tight parking spots than doors on most 2+2 coupes, which have to be wide enough to allow access to the back seats.Ingress/egress requires some flexibility (!), but the BRZ is a low-slung sports car, after all.Visibility - always a big deal for me - is the best you'll find in a sports car.


ram 1500-quad-cab
1 Forward visibility is panoramic, you see exactly where the front wheels are.


ram 1500-quad-cab
1 Rearward is good too but the trunkline is high.


ram 1500-quad-cab
2 Unfortunately the center stoplamp is just obnoxious, I don't think I'll ever stop glancing in the mirror thinking another car is on my tail... Rear 3/4 visibility is, well, better than in a top-up convertible, but the back windows are really just small triangles of light.


ram 1500-quad-cab
1 If your seats are not positioned too far back, and your neck isn't arthritic, you may just see out of them.The Limited comes with all sorts of convenience features (which the Premium trim lacks, as does the Scion FRS), you can read about them on the Subaru website.

2 I was leaning toward the Crossteck XV until I went to the showroom and realized it would be too small for my needs.


ram 1500-quad-cab
2 I haven't liked the styling on the latest generation of the Outbacks, so I gave the Forester a looksee.Subaru's corporate decision to equip only the lower trim models with manual transmission meant I was looking at the base and "premium" trim models.


ram 1500-quad-cab
2 I ended up buying a Premium and was pleasantly surprised by how well the car is equipped and how well it drives.


ram 1500-quad-cab
2 I admit, I was spoiled by the turbo in my old XT, but the natural aspirated 2.5 with the 6 speed stick is very peppy(only 1 second slower that the turbo models, and 2 seconds faster than the CVT models to 60mph) and handles beautifully with just a tad more roll than the Outback.

1 The CVT delivers predictable power on the highway for passing, unlike the old 4eat which made a lot of noise but forgot to downshift.However, not everything is an improvement.


ram 1500-quad-cab
1 Road feel is meh; a step down from the previous model.

ram 1500-quad-cab
1 The chasis bounces a lot.


ram 1500-quad-cab

ram 1500-quad-cab
2 At first it seems to give a lot of power, but often giving it a little more feels dead.

1 Going up steep (and I mean steep) hills this feels underpowered, and where as in the previous model you could downshift, here you can't.

ram 1500-quad-cab
2 I've tried to rev it up to 4k rpm to get power, sometimes it wont let me (foot to floor) sometimes I can punch it there, and I find the power.


ram 1500-quad-cab
1 There's just something unpredictable about the cvt.


ram 1500-quad-cab
1 And we don't get flapper-manual control, so there's no way to compensate.The steering is also lacking the precision of the previous model.


ram 1500-quad-cab
1 You don't want to hit curvy roads fast with this car; unlike the previous model.


ram 1500-quad-cab
1 This has the opposite: nicely weighted, but vague steering.


ram 1500-quad-cab
1 Yes it pulls back to center, but you're going to be cranking the wheel to turn.There's more to note: the cargo space has a higher lift, and I think its actually smaller in terms of grocery space (below the headrests behind the 2nd row), but much bigger if the 2nd row is down.


ram 1500-quad-cab
1 The 2nd row has gotten a lot of extra space which is great, but it had to come from somewhere.


ram 1500-quad-cab
2 Hasn't been a problem so far in grocery fetching, but buyers beware.Some things don't change: fragile interior materials and body paint."

1 I looked around at all the main cars in the class, quickly ruled out the pricey Buick and VW (why not just buy an Audi if you want to spend $40K on a VW).


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 I looked hard at Mazda, Nissan, Toyota, Honda, Ford, Chevy, Hyundai and Subaru (also the Outback).


land-rover range-rover-sport
1 When I see the Caddy commercial that says the car will turn you on -- that is so true!


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 I don't need the Ford's extras and it seems to lag Toyota / Honda.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 I settled on either Honda (which seems to marginally edge Toyota in most reviews) or Subaru--after driving them both several times, the Honda just has no "go".


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 Really struggled uphill.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 It was nicer inside--better interior design by far I think, but the AWD on Subaru can't be beaten in this class.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 Also, Ford, Toyota, Honda have really sacrificed vision for styling.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 Having a tiny back window / side windows means you're forced to take the standard backup camera in Honda--the rear window is useless if you have small kids who may be playing behind.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 The Subaru feels much airier--the windows are big.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 Really big and the backup camera isn't an expensive addition, nor is it needed--I can see my 2 year old if he's just a couple feet behind the car.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 The blindspot is smaller on my Forester than it is on my sedan.

1 It almost forbids soccer moms from driving one, which is the opposite of mom-wagon magnet CR-V / Rav 4. That said, this is my wife's vehicle and it works great.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 The center armrest in the back seat wouldn't decline in the CR-V with our car seat, but it does easily in the Subaru, which really does feel larger inside.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 I would have loved a little more effort to go into the interior design--the dashboard of Honda should be the standard for other manufacturers, but my Subaru feels solid, drives smoothly and feels grounded on the road, and will handle the snow better than any other car in this class given the 100% AWD.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 The mpg is also better than the competition on the new 2014--Mazda is probably similar, but the CX-5 is just a little small, and I still see a huge smile on the front of the updated model.Finally, no other vehicle in this class did as well as the Forester for safety.

ram 1500-crew-cab
1 Subaru made some nice sheet metal changes and needed additions to the CVT for 2014.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 After a test drive, here were our thoughts; First, the car handles reasonably well and the CVT is quiet (unlike the whine of the earlier models).


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 The body rides well and is fairly quiet though the front end plunges in high speed turns.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 Visibility is good except in the rear and the rear view mirror is too small for the vehicle (is it a stock sedan item?).


ram 1500-crew-cab

2 The entry level i series is a good value but extremely bare bones with full manual seats and cloth.

1 Allways bought outbacks because of roof racks, but the 2012outbacks are too darn high to put my bikes on the rack.The Outback swing away crossbars are no good, they rattle and extender crossbars cannot be used.At a recent bike race in Colorado, most Outbacks removed the swing bars and added adaptors to mount better crossbars.The standard optional sedan cross bars are fantastic.They are very solid and are about 10" lower then Outback bars.They are very quiet when driving at 65 mph.The back seat has lots of room to change into bike shoes or ski boots.

2 I rarely write these types of reviews but felt I had to here.I just sold my 08 Accord as a result of the age of that car for my company car allowance, I liked the Accord very much.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 When shopping I had previously ruled out Subaru's because I am 6.3" and they never had enough legroom until this model year (2010).


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 I have to say that this car far exceeds my expectations.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 The seat comfort and support blow away the Accord and the interior space is just right.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 I can sit comfortably in the rear with the fronts seats all the say back.

2 The CVT is very nice to have, it runs super quiet and is ready to kick in and maintains constant RPM's when you step on it.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 People who complain about lack of power are not driving it right.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 Since the car does not have to shift the engine maintains a constant RPM and gets off the line and holds that rom and accelerates and passes nicely.

1 Cadillac...the master of gadgetry.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 The paddles shifters are awesome to use.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 I really dont see the point of using manual for normal driving as it is not as efficient as auto mode but having the downshift paddle in your left hand lets you downshift on downhills for engine braking or when coming to a quick stop while sipping on coffee with your right hand.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 When you stop the CVT automatically kicks back into auto mode.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 Even though the car leans slightly in turns the steering is super solid and responsive and the car does not slide out at all with the lower center of gravity of the boxer engine.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 They have also gone to great lengths to insulate the engine compartment and the car is way quieter then the Accord v(engine and road noise wise).


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 The only downside from the Accord is the trunk hatch does not give you as easy access although the interior shape of the trunk makes the space more usable.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 The interior ergonimics are very good except the climate control and stereo knobs are small and hard to adjust.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 Fortunatley the stereo controls are also on the steering wheel.All in all this is very solid car which is priced similar to the competition but includes all wheel drive which others do not have.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 The comparison numbers also do not factor that in.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 Considering the brand loyalty, better resale, durability, workmanship over Hyundai (KIA, same company), the reliability and durability over the Ford (not to mention less expensive) the CVT and AWD over the Accord and Camry the choice seems obvious (and no I don't work for Subaru but I am in sales)."

2 My last car was a Rav-4, and got 200k out of her in 5 years.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 The ride was choppy, the cargo space was minimal, but is was a gas sipper, and never left me stranded even in the worst blizzards.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 To replace the Rav-4 I purchased the Subaru for all the reasons I mentioned previously, but wanted a smother highway ride and went with the limited because it was loaded, and priced considerably less than its other AWD sedan counterparts(Audi,BMW,Volvo).


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 Loaded with heated leather, moon-roof, Harmon stereo, nicer wheels, etc. THE BAD: The initial fit and finish was somewhat poor, with leaks in the moon-roof, high wind noise at highway speed, the steering wheel mounted controls for blue tooth, stereo and cruise stopped working in the first month, and it had multiple recalls.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 All of which, are not examples of what I had in mind when I thought of what quality stood for.

1 The engine is actually very well balanced for the size of the car, as only being the 4 Cyl, but the reward is better than average highway MPG.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 The power comes on smooth with the CV Transmission, and can be very potent when so needed, at on ramps, toll booths, and will trounce some unsuspecting sedans and coupes at the red lights if so inclined.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 THE BAD: While on a long distance drive, far away from home, the CV transmission just disintegrated, and left me stranded on the side of the highway.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 Dealer came and got the vehicle, which upon inspection, informed me that the transmission was completely destroyed, not just a part of it, but all of it.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 Subaru basically said oh well.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 My gripe is that had this been a KIA or Hyundai, even a Suzuki, which would have cost far less, the repair would have been covered under warranty.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 Prior to this I considered Subaru to be a quality manufacturer, but after this experience, I would seriously question purchasing another vehicle from them.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 I think Subaru was in a rush to get a CVT into the market in order to compete with the Federal Mandates and other competition for better gas consuming vehicles, that they put this model CVT into the Legacy before making it reliable, and ultimately stuck it to the consumer.

1 While the handling is not as crisp as the BMW, it hugs the road quite well.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 Upgrading the shocks made a big difference.Unless you are taking it to the track you won't push the limits of this car.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 The power is simply amazing.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 There is a little turbo lag, but it is easy to get used to and once things kick in you'll be so much farther down the road, you barely notice it.I have an automatic.

1 In Sports mode the shifts are perfectly matched and quite fast.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 In regular mode the shifts are fine and leave you with plenty of torque, but might be a little slow for aggressive drivers.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 Shifting manually is a lot of fun and steering wheel buttons are very handy and easy to use (easier than the paddles on the BMW IMHO).


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 It shifts faster if you just leave it in sport mode though.The interior is very comfortable, even in the back seats a 6 footer is comfortable.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 It would be nice to see them offer real wood trim though.At highway speeds there is a bit of wind noise.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 Nothing too annoying, but that would be one area they could improve on.In summary, the Legacy GT Ltd is a great buy if you want sports car performance with a usable back seat and trunk."

2 I have the 2013 legacy premium with all weather package and added fog lights which I would highly recommend.This car is super comfortable and quiet.

2 My criteria for my new car was to have high fuel economy and safety ( the AWD would be a bonus).


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 The roominess of the car along with the stability of the AWD make for a remarkable ride for a car that looks much more expensive.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 I highly recommend the Legacy.

1 Never in my life would i think to drive a japanese car.

2 WHAT AN AMAZING CAR!

2 The CVT Tranny is a little something to get used to, but they NEVER BREAK! you could put a bullet thru it and it would run fine without any issue!


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 love it in the red, and thankfully i was able to score a deal with Subaru to have a tan interior instead of black ;D *GOTTA LOVE CUSTOMIZATION~*

1 Synthetic oil changes are costly, but the oil does seem to last longer.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 This fact is why I bought it, so, Subaru, don't take this as an opportunity to raise prices.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 We'll run to Hundai or Kia so fast it'll make your head spin.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 As for appearance, I often see a Lexus in the same color, white, and think the Lexus is a Subaru.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 Actually, the Subaru is a Lexus minus $20,000.

mitsubishi galant
1 Took 5 days to come in!).


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 The added features and new body style say alot for this car.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 The fit and finish is the best i've seen.I really don't like saying this but American car companies really need to step up and build a car like this.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 Truly love the car and the price was great too.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 This is my third Subaru and I love each one more than the previous.


ram 1500-regular-cab

ram 1500-regular-cab
1 Love the power and safety of this thing!!!


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 I love letting my friends test drive it and then they usually tell me that they had no idea a Subaru could feel that responsive and tight in all aspects.Subaru car driver for life.

ram 1500-regular-cab
2 The interior is very clean and well put together and the seats are very comfortable.


mitsubishi galant
1 Love the gauges, and the cabin is comfy.


ram 1500-regular-cab

ram 1500-regular-cab
1 A great car for 32,000.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 Great overall car, comfortable and a great lease deal.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 Low on power and the rear suspension seems alittle soft to me, but still a great car for the money.

1 Try to find a Chevy or Ford with the same standard features as a base Legacy and you won't find it.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 Car consistently gets 30+mpg highway (better than advertised!)


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 I have had no--zero--problems.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 I use Plus rather than the required Super except when I'm on a trip where the turbo may be essential (e.g. to pass trucks or RVs on mountain roads), and suspect we could all get by on Regular except for those exceptional circumstances.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 I purchased this car a couple of months ago and have been extremely happy with the vehicle.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 The only real downside is the lack of power provided by the GT model.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 The handling is superior to any car I've owned in the past, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a similar feature list for the same price as a Legacy 2.5i.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 It's a solid buy, but if you can spare the extra 5K I'd strongly suggest upgrading to the GT.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 I love this car!! Great gas mileage, safe, and great in the inclement weather!


ram 1500-regular-cab

2 Subaru makes a superb vehicle.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 Its not overly glamorous but you get a lot for for the money.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 Its is one of the safest cars on the road.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 We have had several Subaru's and they have all stood the test of time.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 I suppose anyone could get a bad car now and then, nothing is perfect.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 But if you are looking for a safe, fairly priced car w/AWD, leather, attractive and do not want the glory of other AWD which will cost sooo much more you should give this car a look.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 I am getting 23-24.9


ram 1500-regular-cab

2 The car looks and drives great.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 Great for traveling and wonderful gas milage.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 My only complaint is that if you are looking for great acceleration look somewhere else...a little slow in this area.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 Other than that this has been an amazing, safe, reliable vehicle.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 Having a hard time with Subaru and warrenty coverage.

1 I wanted this car for a few years and was lucky enough to find a used GT Limited sedan in great condition (I would never buy an new car, its a really poor investment).


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 It is a beautiful car, handles like it is on rails, and has been super reliable.


chevrolet colorado-crew-cab

ram 1500-regular-cab
2 I've put 60k miles on my 2006 Legacy and appreciate its dependability and performance.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 The only weakness is the delay that occurs when doing rapid acceleration.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 In other words, when you floor it, it waits, and waits, and then goes.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 It's probably only 1.5 seconds, but that's enough to get you into a wreck.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 I had to re-learn to drive with this car, but have enjoyed it.


mitsubishi galant
1 The gas milage is not very good and that makes it really hard to drive every day when gas price's are at +/- $3.25.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 Great car... lots of power and comfort.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 Great gas milage for an AWD and turbo.

honda ridgeline
2 Best car I've ever owned.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 Once you have the power of a GT, you will never want to switch to anything else.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 This is an incredible car.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 I recently upgraded my warranty because I plan to keep it a long time.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 Not that there have been any problems (there have been none) but I like the piece of mind, especially after a car starts to get a little older.This car is the "right" size for a family of four.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 Probably not five.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 We have a big dog and had to add a cargo box to the roof to fit the strollers, etc.Then there's the performance factor.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 The GT Wagon with a cargo box on the roof is a definite sleeper.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 Plenty of power for acceleration but a sensible package that is relatively fuel efficient.This car may not have the refinement of BMW 3##xi wagon or Audi A4 Avant but it's not too far behind and much, much cheaper.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 Not a hiccup in 2 years.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 Rocket off the line, agile, comfortable.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 Great ergo's.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 AWD is super sticky.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 Sleeper wagon GT really drops jaws when you blow by an Audi or Acura.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 Almost everything is fantastic about this vehicle except the brakes and body roll.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 I commute from the mountains to the city every day.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 The front rotors overheat very easily.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 Spirited driving with a Lancer led to brake fade and irreparably damaged front rotors.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 When we stopped at a traffic signal, smoke rose from the front wheel wells of my Legacy GT.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 The Lancer appeared to Not have any problems.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 Similar brake problems occurred with my 1994 Legacy Sedan.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 I believe Subaru designs brakes that do not match the capabilities of their performance vehicles.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 I now brake by downshifting to prevent the rotors from overheating.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 Additionally, there is a little body roll that should be tightened up by using firmer than factory roll bars.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 If you drive normally, and on flat ground, this is a perfect car.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 Gas mileage is usually 22.2 to 24.5 mpg.

ram 1500-regular-cab
2 The only car I have owned that might be neck and neck is my 2002 Honda accord.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 I am very happy with this car and have no fear for my 16 year old driving this car solo, cross country.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 Great to drive in the snow and has great handling on the curvy roads!


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 I have 80K miles on my Legacy Limited sedan and am still in love with it.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 It has averaged 29 mpg, drives and handles well, and looks sharp doing it.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 And with AWD, I never have to worry about winter roads--which I drive on a lot.


mitsubishi i-miev
1 I upgraded to the escalade due to the head turning styling.


ram 1500-regular-cab

ram 1500-regular-cab
1 Very fast!!! Love the AWD.

2 Sitting back and thinking of all the things that I like and dislike about this vehicle has been hard.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 Not so great on gas.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 Would love memory on driver seat.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 Seat a little short.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 I'm only 5'2" and don't have long legs, but get cramps in my left leg on longer drives, not enough support.The volume on my radio goes up on its own sometimes.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 I don't know why, haven't had it checked yet.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 I guess it's a way for my little car to keep me alert.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 Little noisy interior, but nothing you can't get used to.Overall great vehicle.


mitsubishi galant
2 Will buy another.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 I went from an Audi A6 Wagon to the Legacy GT Ltd.


chevrolet cruze
1 I am not disappointed.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 Sure it could be roomier and there is a level of luxury that my Audi had that the Subbie doesn't but neither the A6 or the 5 Series put a smile on my face like this one does!


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 The power is great, you can pass people safely and efficiently.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 I still prefer to use the kickdown on the steering wheel and like the fact that you don't need to switch to manual mode for it to work.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 Engine is a bit thrashy and noise can be somewhat pronounced but it is doing something.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 Would have loved memory seats and that extra notch of quality on the interior but overall it's great.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 Windows squeek.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 No other problems to date.


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 Now if they would raise the game and bring out an A6 beater rather than and A4 beater and while they were at it make it a Diesel turbo then we would have the car to take to market.Recently did 5 hour drive in a 16inch snow storm and still here!


ram 1500-regular-cab
2 I think it is a great vehicle, but the seats do tend to hurt my back after long drives.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 The RDX has a powerful V-6 engine that accelerates quickly and smoothly but gets the advertised 28 mpg highway and 20mpg city.


mitsubishi i-miev
1 The seats are heavy to remove, but comfortable for a 3rd row.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 It has a great power for getting onto the freeway.


ram 1500-regular-cab

1 The only camparable vehicle to the 2005 Legacy GT Limited I can think of is an AWD BMW 3-series.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 Now that I'm turning 30, married with 2 young children, this car has the best of all worlds.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 Some qualities come to mind: practical with thoughtful details, very fast/powerful acceleration, upscale interior design, awesome sports car-like body design, handles great (could use more firm shock dampening - nothing a new set if Bilsteins HD's couldn't fix), nimble/precise steering There is no doubt this is a sports car.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 The tuner market for this car is alive and well as is with the Impreza WRX/STi.Compared to other similar vehicles, this car represents the best value.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 The climate control switches and radio are all one unit, thus rendering aftermarket options useless.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 With enough research, you will discovere there are clever options out there.> road/windnoise - it is pronounced at highway speed.

mitsubishi lancer
1 when one pays over $70,000, these things should not be happening."


ram 2500-mega-cab
2 The 08 seems more refined and noticeably quieter and I can occasionally hear a little TURBO whoosh which is kind of nice.


ram 2500-mega-cab
1 The throttle blip down shifts are a blast, but the up shifts are a little too slow.


ram 2500-mega-cab
2 I am keeping my fingers crossed that the 08 front rotors don't warp like my 05's.


ram 2500-mega-cab
2 Overall it is a phenomenal car with superb build quality, razor sharp steering and good handling.


ram 2500-mega-cab
2 With a dose of Ecutek it will be near perfect.

2 I owned the Forester 2013 for 3 months and was already looking to trade it in.


ram 1500-quad-cab
1 What can I say - it was a vehicle full of promise - a very capable of AWD system and wonderful driving visibility - but let down by an antiquated gas guzzling 4 gear transmission, cheap plastic poorly fitted interior, tinny doors, and horribly dated electronics.But the 2014 redesign promised to address most of my complaints, and one test drive later, I had a near identical forester in my driveway.The CVT is such a wonderful improvement.


ram 1500-quad-cab
1 Gas mileage now in the high 20's mph and acceleration, while not inspiring, is at least on par for its class.


ram 1500-quad-cab
1 The ride is now smoother at highway speeds, and electric steering a pretty good implementation.Most importantly, cabin noise is now under control.

1 I went to 13 different dealerships, drove just about every small SUV out there (I missed Suzuki, just because I didn't think of it)and finally chose the 2014 Forester Limited.The CVT really makes this car behave as if it has a lot more horsepower than it does.

1 On the paved side, there was a mix of pretty much every size and type of car.

1 On the rocky road that has water runouts all over it, where a more capable car is needed, it was amazing to find at least half of the cars were Subaru's.

2 I kept saying: "there's another Subie, they're all over."X-mode is amazing, I've never had a car that can apply the brake for you.


ram 1500-quad-cab
2 Driving suggestion: put the transmission in low before using X-mode.


ram 1500-quad-cab
1 Sometimes it will start going too fast and actually turn off X-mode without the car in low.I'm getting 25.2MPG in town, and on the mountain trip, it was 33.2MPG."

ram 1500-quad-cab
1 Acceleration is adequate, though not wonderful -- we did not get the turbo model and preferred the mileage numbers.


ram 1500-quad-cab
2 As for criticisms, I'd first mention that the navigation system is sub-par, not intuitive and Subaru has made it impossible for a passenger to use it while the car is moving -- something we dislike.


ram 1500-quad-cab
2 It's not always possible to pull over and come to a stop and if your passenger is there its silly to limit it.


ram 1500-quad-cab
1 Too much brig-brother there I'd say.


ram 1500-quad-cab
1 The middle console/armrest is smallish, the storage inside is small and the coin holder blocks easy access inside.

1 Manual downshifting -- for sudden slowdowns in traffic or on mountain roads -- saves on brake wear and gives you something to do if you miss not having a stick shift.Steering is reasonably tight and the RDX handles almost like a small car.

1 This SUV is definitely awesome, everything works like a dream and it handles like a sports car.

2 It takes me to where i want to go on or off road, and most importantly through Iowa snow and ice.


ram 1500-quad-cab
2 This car isn't the most powerful there is especially with the cvt transmission, but with a small sacrifice of power and acceleration, it has great gas mileage and its a major factor in my decision when buying a car.

2 At first it seems to give a lot of power, but often giving it a little more feels dead.

ram 1500-quad-cab
1 This has the opposite: nicely weighted, but vague steering.


ram 1500-quad-cab
1 Yes it pulls back to center, but you're going to be cranking the wheel to turn.There's more to note: the cargo space has a higher lift, and I think its actually smaller in terms of grocery space (below the headrests behind the 2nd row), but much bigger if the 2nd row is down.


ram 1500-quad-cab
1 The 2nd row has gotten a lot of extra space which is great, but it had to come from somewhere.

ram 1500-crew-cab
1 I looked hard at Mazda, Nissan, Toyota, Honda, Ford, Chevy, Hyundai and Subaru (also the Outback).


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 I don't need the Ford's extras and it seems to lag Toyota / Honda.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 I settled on either Honda (which seems to marginally edge Toyota in most reviews) or Subaru--after driving them both several times, the Honda just has no "go".

1 It was nicer inside--better interior design by far I think, but the AWD on Subaru can't be beaten in this class.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 Also, Ford, Toyota, Honda have really sacrificed vision for styling.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 Having a tiny back window / side windows means you're forced to take the standard backup camera in Honda--the rear window is useless if you have small kids who may be playing behind.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 The Subaru feels much airier--the windows are big.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 Really big and the backup camera isn't an expensive addition, nor is it needed--I can see my 2 year old if he's just a couple feet behind the car.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 The blindspot is smaller on my Forester than it is on my sedan.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 The Subaru isn't built to impress visually--although the exterior styling is really growing on me.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 It almost forbids soccer moms from driving one, which is the opposite of mom-wagon magnet CR-V / Rav 4. That said, this is my wife's vehicle and it works great.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 The center armrest in the back seat wouldn't decline in the CR-V with our car seat, but it does easily in the Subaru, which really does feel larger inside.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 I would have loved a little more effort to go into the interior design--the dashboard of Honda should be the standard for other manufacturers, but my Subaru feels solid, drives smoothly and feels grounded on the road, and will handle the snow better than any other car in this class given the 100% AWD.

1 Already having an Outback in the driveway, I took a look at the AWD options in the $30k price range.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 I looked at the Rogue, CR-V, CX-5, Venza and Rav-4.Out of those cars, the one I liked the most was the CX-5 AWD Touring.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 I had 2 issues... the biggest being that visibility out of the car was extremely poor.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 It came with a blind spot warning system and backup camera standard... because it really needs them.


mitsubishi lancer
1 Never once regretted the decision after I drove off the lot.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 Power was sufficient (but not great), but the high compression ratio had me worried about reliability.The CR-V drove nicely enough, but I didn't like the interior with the weird gear selector position.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 I also hated the design of the rear exterior.

2 I felt the electric steering was disconnected from the road.

1 They are also so common where I live, I was afraid I wouldn't find my car in the parking lot (just a little humor).The Rav-4 was also decent.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 I liked the idea of the 3rd row seat option (which no dealer seemed to have) and visibility was ok.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 The interior seemed very cheap with hard plastic and a weird black and tan patterned interior.

1 This is our first Subaru and it likely won't be our last.

2 The Outback sips gas (we get 28-34 MPG in mixed city/hghway driving) and, with the auto/CVT w/ manual mode, is a pleasure to drive.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 It's quite comfortable on long drives, has great visibility (not hiindered by design), and goes off-roading with no problems.We added factory-made vent-visors to the windows for improved air circulation; all new cars should come with those but, sadly, don't.Now some reviewers here have gotten "the shakes" from/in their Outbacks and complained about steering-wheel vibration, but we've never had a problem with that.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 The best advice comes from one reviewer who said "Warning to potential buyers: test drive your new car and do not take delivery until all quality standards meet your expectations" -- good words to apply to ANY new car purchase!

2 There is a delay when you throttle the car between 5 and 15 miles per hour, and when it finally registers with the car's computer, the car jerks forcibly and makes a loud popping noise.

2 We sold the 12 and bought the 2013 w/leather.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 The major differences are the 13 no longer has the rubber-belt engine drive, the suspension is much stiffer in the 2013, and steering more positive in the 2013, as the 2012 tended to "float".


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 Apparently the 2013 tranny tweak on the CVT has significantly reduced MPG- though Subaru claims the 2013 gets better MPG than the 2012.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 We drive 95% highway miles and the 2012 averaged 28.2 to 29.4 (two drivers on same daily route) and even up to 31 on I-5.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 The 2013 averages 24.6 to 26.4 MPG with only 27 on I-5 and we are not happy with that.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 The 2013 front-end restyle is also ugly- too much black plastic with huge fog lights.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 We need AWD where we live and the interior space is very nice.


ram 1500-crew-cab

1 I seriously think that the sorry excuse of a unit Subaru has the gall to call navigation unit is peddled with the rear-view camera because no one will buy this horrendous feature without it.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 I have GPS units one twentieth the price that are more useful, predictable, give traffic information, does better navigation (i.e., doesn't route me through horrible traffic when an obvious better alternative exists), and has better features (E.g., breadcrumbs feature, ability to use terrain maps as an input SD card) than this one.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 And don't even get me started about touch screen features on this one.


mitsubishi outlander
1 I test drove the Porsche Cayenne S and GTS, Range Rover, Q7, Escalade, Yukon Denali, and Expedition.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 The points of interest are a bit of a joke (not updated since the BC era), and saving a memory point or an address etc. gives me a headache.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 I need to talk to the engineer who designed this.

1 Pronto.The only nice thing I can say about this navi is that the voice for the navigation is excellent.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 I used to be very averse to my GPS talking to me.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 Not so with this one.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 It sounds crisp and well integrated with the audio, and very timely alerts, and useful screen.Apart from my main peeve which I detailed above, I do have some misgivings about the stated mpg--don't believe it.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 My previous car, a Honda--was listed at 32mpg highway and 25 mpg on city, and it regularly gave me 35 mpg until I sold it (more than a decade old car).

2 I am not satisfied with the mileage (only managed about 19mpg so far, and I am no speed demon).

hyundai santa-fe
2 I have asked my service dept to look in to it.


mitsubishi outlander
1 I chose the Navigator.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 I am a big fan of the older Subarus--the post 2009 Subaru Outbacks are too bulky, SUV looking for my liking, so I give this car no points for looks.I think the other default settings that warrant some attention are (a) sensitivity of the "auto" headlight feature--turns on the headlights/dims the navi even when passing a 50-ft tunnel at 75mph and (b) The default EQ settings for the audio are horrendously bassy, but I can't expect audiophile quality inside a car.The car in general is a clunky feeling car.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 Despite being a very expensive car, this car does not have much refinement; refinement I can expect in a car half the price (try the newer Civics).


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 There are items I took for granted on an older, cheaper car that I cannot take for granted on this Subaru--an simple button for tripmeter reset, for example, instead of a prong that does the same on the Subaru.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 A requested service code (try these on for size on the newer Hondas) on the display rather than nothing on the Subaru!On the plus side, I find the Subaru quite a treat to drive.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 The interior is certainly luxurious feeling, and the audio system is quite nice.The audio wrt iPod is just incredible, and I quite like being able to control the iPod from the steering wheel.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 For those of you hoping to move your entire music to your iPod with your new Subaru, I heartily recommend you to do so!


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 And yes, the car charges your iPod while connected.

1 Summer came, did not notice until heat was needed again.


ram 1500-crew-cab

1 Actually, I am not particularly enamored with the new appearance, but it is OK.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 I was torn between the practicality of an outback, and a sporier model from a different brand, but practicality won out, and I think I made the right decision.

ram 1500-crew-cab
1 Too short, too hard seats and left-shifted brake and gas pedals which are also placed at a too steep angle compared to "normal" cars enforce a very unnatural, twisted right leg posture that causes permanent stress on the knee and ankles, resulting in persistent knee pain, patellar tendon pain and even cramps in lower leg muscles.

ram 1500-crew-cab
1 The system uses voice tags for voice activated phone contacts.

2 It will not except one syllable names.


ram 1500-crew-cab
1 If you try it tells you the name is too short.3.

2 This is the 5th Subaru I've owned (and the 7th I've driven) and I truly wanted to love it more, but there's a few things I don't like.


scion xb
1 Haven't had any major mechanical or electrical issues to date.


scion xb
1 One little thing with the auxillary jack but that was fixed under warrantee.-


scion xb
2 One of the biggest issues with how well your AWD works is what type if tires you have on the vehicle.


scion xb
2 Even with new all-season and/or winter tires on this Tribeca the AWD did not handle as well in the ice and snow as my previous Outback and Outback sedans did.


ram 1500-quad-cab
2 love it but its got to go im getting a 1014 model


scion xb
2 Even with extra weight in the back cargo area, not much of a change.


scion xb
1 As AWD is a main feature of Subaru vehicles, I was disappointed with the performance.-


scion xb
1 Gas mileage is kind of sad for something of this size.


scion xb
2 You can get used to the 18 mpg but the size of the gas tank (only 16.4 gallons) tends to be the killer.


scion xb
2 It would be nice to have a bigger tank so you don't have to fill up as often out of paranoia alone.


scion xb
2 And/or better mpg.-


scion xb
1 Leg room in the 3rd row of seats is almost non-existent.


scion xb
2 I'm a 5'4" small adult and could not sit back there comfortably.


scion xb
2 Truly meant for kids only.-


scion xb
1 LOVE the A/C in the back rows coming from the top with the heat still coming from the floor for the back rows.


ram 1500-quad-cab
1 it turns heads even now it is prestigeous and would not sell it for less than 35k


scion xb
2 Very smart on Subaru's part not to have hot air blasting on your face like other SUV's.-


honda odyssey
1 Seats are comfortable.


scion xb
1 Back row seats are a little stiff but still comfortable.


scion xb
1 Leather quality is outstanding.


scion xb
2 Doesn't wear or get shiny quickly like some Chevy/GMC/Ford vehicles.-


scion xb
2 Not much storage in this vehicle at all.


scion xb
2 Small consoles and jockey box areas (due to V6 engine for the jockey I'm sure).-


scion xb
2 Overall, I'm very confident driving this vehicle in dry or wet conditions.


scion xb
2 Don't trust it as much in the snow/ice and definitely not in the mud.


scion xb
1 The VDC is worthless in country mud.


chevrolet avalanche
2 I absolutely love this vehicle.


scion xb
2 More of an annoyance really.I wouldn't buy another one of these again.


scion xb
1 I still love Subaru and wouldn't hesitate to purchase an Outback or even an Impreza.


scion xb
1 I just wish they would come out with a better 7-seater alternative."

2 I bought the first B9 Tribeca sold in Nashville TN in May 2005.


scion xb
1 I choose it over the Honda Pilot (didn't handle as well), the BMW X3 (too jittery on the highway), and the Toyota Highlander (felt like a couch on wheels).


scion xb
1 In Augusst 2006 I took it in for an oil change and drove out in a new 2006 model!


scion xb
2 I had no problems whatsoever with the car, just got a great deal on a new one with a navagation system.


scion xb
2 I now have 41K miles on my second Tribeca, still get a combined mpg of 22.5.


ram 1500-quad-cab
1 Sad to see the new design for 2013.


scion xb
2 I love the way handles (not as nervous as the BMW 3X, as I said, but almost as quick and much less expensive), I love its distinctive style, the security of all-wheel drive, and its safety features.Too bad Consumers Report did not conisder the 5 seat model, the one I have.


scion xb
1 It has pleanty of room everywehre.


scion xb
1 This is a perfect car for a young family or for retirees who desire comfort on a long trip.My only complaint is that the motor requires premium gas for best results."

2 The Tribeca is great for warmer weather.


scion xb
2 I have owned this vehicle for three years and am ready to trade it in.


scion xb
2 The windshield wipers tend to frost over in cold weather and do not adequately wipe, thus causing a hazard when driving in cold climates.


scion xb
1 The electronics slow down in the cold weather, which means your entire electronic panel for review is extremely slow to display.


scion xb
1 The seat heaters don't activate until you sit on them, even when you get into a warm car in cold weather, the leather seat is cold (not fun in -15F weather).


ram 1500-quad-cab
1 Unless it looks different when it hits the ground in September, will probably look at other vehicles.


scion xb
2 Window tends to ice over in cold weather even with heat blowing (wipers accumulate ice, wiper heaters do not remove the ice, and the window defrost is insufficient).Another problem is changing the headlights.


scion xb
2 I have had my third headlight burn out and you cannot replace them yourself.


scion xb
1 On one side you will have to remove the battery, on the other side they had to remove the whole bumper to replace the headlight.


scion xb
1 Simple headlight change will cost you $100+ for labor.


scion xb
1 Good luck trying it yourself!Hence, I am ready to trade in the car because it does not perform well in below zero temps.


scion xb
2 Major disappointment for the money spent on this car."


scion xb
1 I went into this car search with the following criteria; SUV or Crossover, 6 cyl,, AWD or 4WD, Room for snowboards in back (don't like roof racks).


scion xb
2 Upon checking many dealerships, I quickly learned that I needed to add a third row seat to the search criteria, along with captain's chair in the second row to have our ski's and snowboards fit inside the vehicle, and when I go to pick up 2x4's for projects around the house.Coming from a Lincoln Navigator, I wanted all the nice features as well; heated seats, leather, memory seats and power everything, etc.


scion xb
1 I also realized that I wanted all wheel drive only and not 4WD, as I did not want to have to think so much about when and when not to use 4WD.


ram 1500-quad-cab
2 This is my 2nd escalade.


scion xb
2 I want AWD, all the time, as safety in the winter months is critical up in the mountains.Upon performing a KBB smart car search, it listed 7 possible cars.


scion xb
2 I then went through the pictures with the kids for their impression on style and looks.


scion xb
2 This whittled the list to 3 choices; Ford Taurus X, Saturn Outlook, and the Subaru Tribeca.


scion xb
2 Based on further research on pricing for the features desired, my preferred order was Ford, Subaru, and Saturn.


scion xb
2 I then set up my test drives based on this and hoped that I would fall in love with the Ford (based primarily on price) and we would be done with it, as I hate shopping, especially for cars.The Ford Taurus X Limited was everything we hoped for when we first eyed it.


scion xb
2 It was loaded with every feature possible, and for almost $4k less than the Subaru, based on Ford's new pricing structure (pay what employee's pay).


scion xb
1 However, when I sat in the car the first thing I noticed was that I could not extend my left leg completely.


scion xb
2 Granted I am 6'1" with long legs, but I have never had driven a car where I felt cramped where the driver's seat could not go back far enough to accomodate me.


scion xb
1 For long weekend trips up to ski country, I knew this was going to be a deal breaker.


scion xb
2 The main reason is on the way home from skiing, I always find myself wanting to stretch then legs due to the burn created on the slopes.


ram 1500-quad-cab
2 Love the look and comfort, prefer more storage space and a net to hold items in back area,does NOT have line in MP3 player and would prefer the line in MP3 player like the '08 and newer, Carpet had red stain that seems to be PAINTED over instead of the dealer replacing carpet when it was purchased.


scion xb
2 I took the car out for a drive anyway to see if I could get over this fact.


scion xb
1 Other noticeable items was that wind noise (it was windy that day) seemed more noticeable than my Navigator.


scion xb
1 Also, when starting from a stop in city driving, the gear transition seemed to be a bit slow.


scion xb
1 However, when trying to get into the fast lane the gear transition was smooth when accelerating with plenty of power.


scion xb
1 Back to the legroom, it was the deal breaker.


scion xb
2 So off to the Subaru dealership, though questioning in my mind if I could live with the lack of legroom.When doing a walk around with the Subaru Tribeca, I really loved the look of the car.


scion xb
1 The Ford was a little too boxy for me, but for $4k less, I still would have went with the Ford.


scion xb
1 Then I sat on the inside of the Tribeca, another score for Subaru.


scion xb
1 The interior and dash console of the Tribeca is beautifully laid out, actually awesome how they curve of the design wraps around you.


scion xb
1 OK, now the thought of the extra $4k maybe not so bad.

1 The new extended warranty is NOT complete as was our last extended warranty!


scion xb
1 Then the actual test drive...I felt this car drives almost as nice as my president's top of the line Lexus.


scion xb
1 The transmission gearing was very smooth city or highway with excellent pick up when getting into the fast lane.


scion xb
2 Handling and cornering (i.e.


scion xb
2 suspension) on the Tribeca was much tighter than the Ford Taurus X and the seats were firmer for long haul trips.


scion xb
2 When considering all these facts, the $4k difference melted away.On talking with people who owned Subaru's I had nothing but high praise for quality; my wife's co-worker has a Subaru Forrester with >300k miles, a lady in a restaurant we happened to sit next to the night before loves her Subaru, my neighbor (a car conneseur) stated that his first choice for a new car would be a Honda Ridgeline, and for a family car, the Subaru Tribeca.


scion xb
1 BTW...I looked at the Honda Ridgeline and was not immpressed, also, my wife crushed any thoughts of going this way.


scion xb
2 This list of praise from various people was that Subaru makes a high quality product, so this eased my mind on the quality and reliability side.I then called the Saturn dealership and informed them that I would not be test driving their vehicle.


scion xb
1 I just loved the Subaru that much, and it would replace the loss of my beloved Lincoln Navigator without skipping a beat (8 cylinders and <13 mpg highway included).


scion xb
1 Truthfully, if the length of the driver's side was 1-2" more on the Taurus X, I would have never even went to test drive the Subaru.


ram 1500-quad-cab
1 Really like the large screen for touch stereo and navigation.


scion xb
1 So, Ford's loss is Subaru's gain.


scion xb
1 I am still amazed that a Japanese manufacturer would give more driver's side legroom than an American manufacturer.


scion xb
1 Actually, I am stunned.Also, as a side note, I was deeply disappointed with the Toyota Highlander.


scion xb
2 I have always heard great things about Toyota, went to their showroom, and just felt the quality of the interior, and doors were cheap.


scion xb
1 This is by far the best vehicle that anyone could purchase.


scion xb
1 You cant beat the engineering and safety measures that go into these automobiles.


scion xb
1 They are very reliable as well as comfortable in every way.


scion xb
2 I would be willing to say that anyone who gets into one of the B9 Tribeca's will absolutely LOVE it from then on.


ram 1500-quad-cab
1 The DVD screen is also larger with wireless headsets.


scion xb
2 In my opinion, "You can't beat a Subaru.""

2 This is the most comfortable and most mechanically sound vehicle I have ever had.Having said that, unlike other reviewers who feel it is incredibly sure-footed, mine went sideways during a snowstorm, probably on black ice, but, not something I expected from an AWD system that is so highly touted.


scion xb
1 That happened over a year ago and I've gotten past it and realized there are still things I love about the B-9 (the name Tribeca is not one) and other things that make me wonder.


scion xb
1 The gas mileage can be pretty good on a long drive.

1 With luck and not too much starting & stopping I could avg.

2 The leather is beautiful, very high quality and is abundant throughout the car.


scion xb
2 The lumbar support is inadequate and we experience back pain after driving for only and hour or so.


scion xb
1 Also with the steering wheel set so far away from the driver and no arm rests, your arm and shouders get cramped/tired unless you hold the steering wheel at the bottom and let your arms rest on your thighs.,

ram 1500-quad-cab
1 And the exterior to me is the best.


scion xb
2 But, in terms of pure luxury, comfort, features, and even handling for an SUV, this 2011 Tribeca is by far the best vehicle I have owned, or driven.The flat, horizontally opposed, 24 valve six cylinder aluminum engine is unbelievably smooth and powerful providing more than ample acceleration either from a complete stop or from 60MPH on the highway.


scion xb
1 Paired with the 5 forward speed automatic transmission, the torque and horsepower performance rivals that of many sports cars.


scion xb
1 I know because I have owned a number of coveted sports cars during my life, and even traded one in for my 2011 Tribeca.The features and interior design provide a comfort level that rivals that of many luxury automobiles.


scion xb
1 In fact, until stumbling across the 2011 Tribeca, I had planned on purchasing a new luxury car.


scion xb
1 Needless to say, the Tribeca changed my mind immediately.Best of all, the 5 star safety score, from the IIHS is the icing on the cake.Normally, I would provide a few cons in a review such as this.

ram 1500-quad-cab
1 It does drive like a dream in the snow and rain.


scion xb
1 Ground clearance is great.


scion xb
1 Power is great.Less than great: transmission-it's clunky, gas mileage- rarely gets even close to EPA- they must determine that with an empty car- not one loaded to the gills for skiing with 4 people a dog and a cat!


scion xb
1 The only real negative is the fuel range- poor gas mileage and small gas tank= frequent stops at the pump.


scion xb
1 the seats are starting to show signs of age- getting uncomfortable on long rides.


scion xb
1 Otherwise, still going strong after 125K!


scion xb
1 rides like it is brand new!

2 Haven't enjoyed driving or being in a vehicle since my first vehicle, a 1976 Celica.

2 My wife, a Subaru lover, convinced me to buy this car and I have not been disappointed.


scion xb
1 After three plus years it still looks new, handles well in all types of weather, and is very comfortable.


scion xb
1 Too bad the model will is be discontinued in 2013.

2 I never had any problems with it.


scion xb
2 I've logged some long road trips in this car and it's been comfy and felt solid all the way.


scion xb
1 Great cargo space, too.


scion xb
1 For the money, I wish it were a little better at insulating the cabin from road noise.


scion xb
1 And I wish I had gotten the backup up assist devices as this vehicle is bigger than what I am used to driving and the visibility is not as good as my my Forester.


scion xb
1 But I wanted a better ride and more cargo room, so my Tribeca can't be beat in those areas.

ram 1500-quad-cab
1 The only time it was EVER in the shop was when I took it in for routine service -- and it wasn't rediculously expensive when I did.It has all the power I would ever need to tow or get out of trouble on the road.


scion xb
1 People always ask what car this is, and I do still like the fact that at least here in Orange County, not many of these are on the road.


scion xb
2 Only small complaints: not a lot of get-up-and-go at first push of the gas pedal when needed in passing or on hills, and mileage only so-so at 19 MPG or so (unless freeway driving destination)....though this may be a factor of the aforementioned acceleration issue.


scion xb
1 EXTREMELY reliable!


scion xb
2 We have only required oil changes.


scion xb
1 So glad we didn't get the Touareg, which is getting awful reliability reviews.


scion xb
2 I traded in a toyota highlander for my 2006 subaru.


scion xb
1 I loved the highlander but didn't love the payment at the time.


scion xb
2 The subura is a little difficult to see out of and had some problems with the front end at first.


scion xb
1 But the shop --after a year made everything right.

2 It is a nice comfortable ride and the back seat is way roomier then the highlander.

scion xb
2 It has everything we need and much more.


scion xb
2 My only complaint would be seating.


scion xb
1 If we use the 2nd row seats it doesn't give much foot room for either the 1st row or the 2nd row.


scion xb
2 Works well for us because we typically only use one or the other but for a big famiy, foot room might be a problem.

2 Probably the only negatives I have is that the ride can be a little rough from time to time, but that is my own fault for putting low profile snow tires on it.

scion xb

scion xb
2 I would recommend this vehicle to anyone interested in cross-over SUV.

scion xb
2 Tons of space lots of legroom in the front and back seats.


scion xb
2 Every option we wanted and then some.


scion xb
2 Its got a very stylish dash and its easy to see out of.


scion xb
2 Subaru reliability has always been top notch and their AWD systems are 2nd to none.Body style is a bit bubbly for my personal taste and I'd of put a bit more power under the hood but I can see why they didn't for Gas ecconomy.

ram 1500-quad-cab
2 Just ordered my new one :)


scion xb
2 We looked everywhere for the perfect SUV for our family, and this is it.


scion xb
1 The NAV system is great, the backup camera is a good feature, the ride is fantastic, and the seats are on the same comfort level as my BMW 5 series.


scion xb
1 Then add to that the fact that unlike other SUV's with limited rear legroom at best, the rear seat is adjustable forward and bakward as well to accomodate any size rear seat passenger (I am 6'4" and fit perfectly).


scion xb
1 Too bad more Californians don't know about this car, it has been great for us.

1 Great car.


scion xb
2 Fast, responsive, and attractive.


scion xb
1 Interior is terrific.


scion xb
1 My only objection is the price.


scion xb
2 The standard features of the regular Tribeca do not include the little niceties that come on other models.


scion xb
2 Example: the car come with only a 1 disc CD player (with no option to get the 6 disc player).


scion xb
1 For $30,000+, I expect more.

scion xb
2 I would recommend for safety and durability to anyone who has never had a Subaru to buy one.


scion xb
1 I continue to rave over the punch that the motor has , as well as the handeling is very good.


scion xb
2 I traded in a high end luxury car for it and never looked back.


scion xb
2 This car has been a great investment - a little low on miles/gallon (especially with the rising cost of premium fuel).


scion xb
1 Sometimes shifts hard on hills, but other than that has performed very well.


scion xb
2 The Tribeca 2008 SUV is worth the money.


scion xb
2 Tribeca is wonderful to drive exceeding all expectations with regards to handling, power, interior comfort, and exterior design.

scion xb
2 It feels stable and solid, yet fleet and maneuverable (that is a winning combination for me.)The


scion xb
1 mileage I'm getting is terrific.


scion xb
1 On a long highway trip I averaged 31-32, mixed with a lot of stop and go city driving I'm averaging 26.


scion xb
2 The MPG estimator on the dash helped me feel the car out for it's specific performance quirks and my MPG has improved as a result.The primary negative review I read before purchasing was regarding a weaker engine.


scion xb
1 I do not find this to be the case.


scion xb
2 Of course I traded in my Honda Fit when I bought it which was no powerhouse, and I don't hall a trailer full of horses up muddy inclines regularly, but I do drive a lot and through all kind of conditions and terrains and the engine has been doing just fine.The inside is comfortable and well designed.


scion xb
1 Clean and simple, which appeals to me.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 I will definitely own it for a while and probably buy another one in the near future.


scion xb
1 Not a massive cargo area, but again if that's what you're looking for go for a regular full sized SUV.If you're idea of a perfect car is a small SUV/rugged hatchback that is all terrain capable, cool looking, reliable, fuel-efficient, comfortable, etc etc etc....


scion xb
1 This is probably the best option on the market.My


scion xb
2 only negative is that I paid top dollar since I bought it when it was first released, no negotiating at the dealership.


scion xb
1 Though considering the leather seats, review camera, all-weather package, and everything else standard in a Subaru- top dollar still wasn't that high!" 35 people out of 35 found this review helpful

1 Brand new in the driveway!


scion xb
1 I like it a lot.


scion xb
1 It is zippy off the start, has a solid road feel, handles corners well, and can provide enough power when needed, if you know how to use the pedal.


scion xb
1 The CVT transmission works best when you avoid holding the pedal down, but instead punch it about a quarter down, ease up, and then steadily and gradually press down again.


scion xb
1 EASILY enough power to pass, go uphill, etc.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 easier to drive, park, and look at than any other car or SUV I ever owned!


scion xb
1 And use the paddle shifter to downshift when braking.


scion xb
1 It gives great assist and saves on the brake pads.The review that cited the inability of the Crosstrek to climb a step, heavy snow hill is worrisome, if you regularly need to go up a steep, heavy snow hill!


scion xb
1 That's probably gonna be about .01


scion xb
1 percent or less of owners.


scion xb
1 I will need it to get up a long, snowy driveway with a slight hill at the end, and expect it to do well, as my previous Subarus have done.


scion xb
1 The possible difference with a steep hill might have something to do with the weight of the vehicle.


scion xb
1 It is considerably lighter than an Outback.

2 I spent 12 years in my beloved Chevy Tahoe and found it hard to settle on a replacement car - until I saw the Crosstrek for the first time.

2 My Escalade ESV, Platium is so beautiful that I tell her she is beautiful and lovingly call her "Big Bertha"!

2 It snowed the same day we bought it, and driving around the snowy hills of our town proved to be no problem.

2 We took it out for a short road trip into the mountains with snow-blown roads, and it handled them like a champ.


scion xb
2 My husband and I have always driven 6 cylinder mid-size sedans, and I was concerned about losing power with a 4 cylinder.


scion xb
1 However, this has not been an issue, the engine has plenty of pep.


scion xb
1 The transmission is a bit slow when switching from park to reverse, or reverse to drive, but I think this has to do with the CVT.


scion xb
2 Still working on figuring out how to use the CVT to the maximum benefit, but I can see it being handy during summer road trips.


scion xb
2 Can't wait to take it to our favorite camping spots and see how it does on the dirt roads.

scion xb
1 The car is squatty, and I love that.The CVT is new to me and I don't punch it or push it, but maybe that's it... I'm still getting used to it and I'm being too careful with it because the engine does rev pretty high during normal acceleration getting on the freeway.


scion xb
1 That's the only thing.


scion xb
2 I read about the Hybrid version for next year which will give it a 15 horsepower push which may be just what it needs to improve the driving experience.I know I may be nitpicky, but that's how I feel.

1 Purely a dream to drive!


scion xb
1 I was very excited anticipating the release of the new Crosstrek.


scion xb
2 I needed to replace my 2005 Outback with 190,000+ miles because I'm taking a 3-month roadtrip.


scion xb
1 I ordered a Crosstrek.


scion xb
2 When it arrived at the dealership I was eager to take it for a test drive.


scion xb
1 Before I even got into the car I realized there would be a problem with the driver's seat.


scion xb
1 The bench section does not tilt!


scion xb
1 It slopes "wrong", deeper in the back and high under the knees.


scion xb
2 As I drove it for a mile or two I could feel the pressure on the back of my knees.


scion xb
2 This would not do on my upcoming long drives crosscountry.


scion xb
1 I bought a Forester Premium because it does have an adjustable seat.


ram 1500-crew-cab
2 I am going to buy another one.


scion xb
2 I'm getting worse fuel efficiency than my old 2005 but will take it on my trip and then decide whether to keep the Forester.


scion xb
2 I suggest you pay attention to how the Crosstrek seat fits....like new shoes....it might take a while.


scion xb
2 I'm a grumpy Subaru owner.....give me a new car just like my 2005 Outback."


scion xb
2 I traded my 2004 4Runner, which I also bought new, for the 2011 SR5 version with a few perks.


scion xb
2 I absolutely love it and have not been disappointed in the least with my purchase.


scion xb
1 The only part of the new one I like less than my previous version is that the deck lid on my truck does not close automatically and it takes a bit of a shove to close it all the way.

scion xb
1 I have the trail edition and it is aptly named.


scion xb
2 Can keep up with a jeep rubicon unlimited in most situations but drives far better when back on the pavement.

1 Fuel economy is decent given 9.6 inches of ground clearance, non all-season tires, and 4750lb curb weight.

scion xb
1 Not even an option.


scion xb
1 They give you power running boards before you can get a power tailgate.

1 But the 4Runner is a much more solid vehicle and I have no doubt it will take more punishment.

1 One unexpected bonus with the 4Runner: Very good rear window visibility, which seems to be a thing of the past with other vehicles.

2 Reason being, winter potholes and poorly paved roads took tall on my crossover.

2 Thus, my next vehicle had to be sturdier.


scion xb
2 So far we took 4Runner on the long trips, and it is a very comfortable vehicle.


scion xb
1 Its cargo area is made of durable materials, so bikes, boxes, etc. are not a threat to the interior.

1 Also cruising on the higway is better than I expected in terms of comfort and noise (very low rpms on the overdrive/5th gear.)

2 Outstanding value dollar per dollar "The 2011 4Runner is an outstanding value in any camp!


scion xb
1 The 2011 is all that you could want in an SUV.


scion xb
1 The frame gives it outstanding strength and stability.


scion xb
2 To consider any other manufacturer is a mistake.


scion xb
1 It gets great gas mileage and has towing torque that is stellar.

2 Smooth driving and comfortable seating.


scion xb
1 It exudes safety and comfort beyond any other SUV on the market.

1 Great vehicle if you want to be able to keep up with your buddy's Jeep offroad (almost) without sacrificing too much when it comes to street comfort.


scion xb
1 The Trail Edition is definitely a compromise on the road versus the current SUV crop however once the going gets tough you simply will not need to worry.


scion xb
1 If you are comparing an Explorer, Subaru, and 4Runner you probably don't want the 4Runner (Trail Edition).

1 I CAN'T BELIEVE I OWN THIS VEHICAL.


scion xb
1 IT IS SO CLASSY AND SMOOTH RIDING.

2 Great family vehicle with dual zones for temperature, audio and indiviudal heated seats.


scion xb
2 I WASH IT EVERY TIME IT GETS A LITTLE DIRTY BECAUSE IT IS SOOOOOOO SPECIAL.

1 IF I EVER TRADE IT, IT WILL BE FOR ANOTHER TOYOTA SR-5." 5 people out of 6 found this review helpful


scion xb
1 I traded a Lexus GS430, that was a great car but I wanted back into an SUV.


scion xb
1 My last SUV was a BMW X5 so I was a little worried that the Toyota would seem cheap by comparison.


scion xb
2 In short I can tell the difference in ride stiffness but I paid tens of thousands less and I am happy with the 4Runner, no regrets.


scion xb
2 The controls for the radio and iPod and the AUX and Bluetooth connections are a little odd but other than that no complaints.


scion xb
1 I wish I hadn't taken the third row, I never use it.


scion xb
2 Styling is great, much improved over past years.

2 I get about 20-21 MPG on the road, but my driving mix is mostly highway." 5 people out of 6 found this review helpful


scion xb
1 Wanted the 3rd row for extra seating - not mandatory seating so the fact that you have less then a foot of "trunk" space when 3rd row is up is not a problem for me but definitely would be if you needed that space.


scion xb
1 The space when all the seats are down is crazy (I've put in 2 twin box springs without hesitation).


scion xb
1 I've previously owned a 2003 Limited V8 and have found the 4 runner to be the best vehicle I've had no matter the year.


scion xb
2 It's beefy body makes me feel safe and I know all the off roading options on there and air bags are actually going to keep me safe.


scion xb
2 I'm in my car for 2 hours each day and never get uncomfortable in the car.


scion xb
2 I heard the "wind" noise everyone talks about but after a week quit hearing it - it's called a radio - it's really not that bad.Pros: much roomier then the older models and other mid size SUVs like the Mariner (owned and hated).


scion xb
1 2nd row has just as much space and has sliding seats which provide even more space.


scion xb
1 Lots of features for off roading.


ram 1500-regular-cab
1 No Complaints


scion xb
1 Decent gas mileage for its size - I average 17.5 and drive highway and city.


scion xb
1 AC outlets so no converters.


scion xb
1 The sound system sounds so good people ask me what I've put in ther (nothing).


scion xb
1 4 window automatic windows (it's the little things).Cons: Lumbar support seams to creek at least once every trip.


scion xb
2 Slip control seems odd - ocassionally when stoped on a hill if I push the gas pedal just so it starts to "slip" Toyota says it's operating like it should but the 03 never did that.


scion xb
2 Not easy to get into the 3rd row - kids or small adults only.


scion xb
1 No storage with 3rd row up.Bottom line: you may pay more for the 4Runner with all the options than its peer but you get what you pay for.


scion xb
1 The 4runner is going to hold its value and last longer than those "good deals."


scion xb
2 I've owned the car for less than a year and already owe what it's still worth - says a lot with the typical first year depreciation."

2 I rented many vehicles from Enterprise and Hertz to "live with" all the models I was considering (and to see how they had held-up with all the different crazy drivers they see), and the Yaris' were always "tight and right" regardless of how many rental-car thrashing miles were on them...except one particular Yaris (I rented 3 different Yaris' once I narrowed my search down) that had been wrecked and had a very worn tire that roared on the highway.


scion xd
1 But it still drove pretty good considering what it had been through and they were still renting it out.


scion xd
1 This is not a high volume seller for Toyota because of the Corolla and Prius C being priced slightly higher than the Yaris.


acura mdx
1 This customer did not provide a text review.


scion xd
1 That is a shame, for it might possibly be one of their best built cars.


scion xd
2 I love the fact that it has the bullet-proof 1.5L engine and old-tech transmission that have been around for "many" years with used one's out there in the 300+ thousand- mile range with very little (if any) problems.


scion xd
1 Plenty of space for larger people, great legroom in back.


scion xd
2 Trunk space kinda small with rear seats up, but fold them down?....and you get a "lot" of room back there (enough for two people to go to the beach for a week or camping for a week).


scion xd
1 Rides great, gas mileage is great, it is pretty quiet on the road (never understood how the Car Magazines said it is noisy....try a Rio5 when it is cold...sounds like a blender grating ice.


scion xd
1 That worried me when the Rio5 salesman said "That is Gas Direct Injection Technology, it quiets down once it warms up" I did not like that at all.


scion xd
1 And many small cars are going to that Gas Direct Injection...except the Yaris..."yay").


scion xd
1 The old-tech transmission on the Yaris is a smooth, very simple automatic transmission that does not need 5th or 6th gearing.


scion xd
2 It is a road cruiser!


scion xd
1 It keeps up with and passes traffic plenty-fine...quite peppy once broken-in correctly!


scion xd
2 The simplicity of the car is what attracted me compared to Rio5, Accent, Fiesta, Fiat, Versa and Fit.


scion xd
2 Did not try the Mazda2 due to past experience with that company.


scion xd
1 The Yaris' just felt better built than those others and too many features eventually break after time and are not cheap to fix.


scion xd
2 The only thing I do not like is that the dash and door panels can mark-up easily (have to keep a microfiber towel around) and the bluetooth has cut-out on me once in a while...probably the fault of my flip phone and no tachometer except on the SE Model.


scion xd
1 But I do enjoy this car.


scion xd
2 Sure, I could have bought something more exciting, but the Yaris is fun, simple, comfortable and the "VERY Simple Maintenance" requirements make it a great value as well.


scion xd
1 It does not pretend to be something it is not.


scion xd
2 I got it for a very fair price...some dealers are willing to deal.


scion xd
1 It has the features you truly only need (power everything, remote, tilt, a/c, cruise, great stereo, bluetooth)and nothing more.


scion xd
1 It is worth a look."

2 Not thinking it through, I got the basic model without power windows or locks (Stupid decision on my part, I know).


scion xd
1 However, after having the car for a year..


scion xd
2 The car literally drives - and rides like a go cart.


scion xd
2 Which is great and fun, but now that I am older, and driving longer distances I have found that the car is VERY uncomfortable for long drives.


scion xd
1 Like I said, this is a wonderful, affordable car for teenagers and younger people, but if you are looking for a luxury vehicle this is not it.

2 I have issues with large trucks and 18 wheelers coming over into my lane on top of me -whether that be bad luck or not, it hasn't happened as often as it does when I drive the Yaris.


scion xd
2 Also, when I am trying to accelerate onto the nterstate it is VERY hard to get the car up to speed in a short acceleration lane.

1 I'm always recommending this car to everyone I meet that has anything to say about it.


scion xd
2 It's my first Toyota and I can see why the engines have such a good rep.


scion xd
1 The Yaris is so tiny yet so practical in every way imaginable.You can park this thing anywhere, the turning radius allows you to pull a U-turn on any street, and the handling feels like a much more expensive sport hatch.


scion xd
1 The listed economy figures are very conservative: I get 40mpg easily, and I can do that while still having the oomph to pass most cars I see on the road.


scion xd
2 Granted, mind is a manual which gives me an edge, but it's just so much fun to drive and doesn't break the bank.I was amazed at how much storage space there is inside; they put compartments everywhere, even a second glove box behind the steering wheel.


scion xd
1 Really smart design.


scion xd
1 I only took a point off for quality as there is an abundance of cheap-ish plastic, but you're not paying for a Rolls-Royce here so that's ok with me.

1 My husband hit a deer on the highway, and no major damage was to be had, just cosmetic.

1 I was looking for a new ride for almost a year.


scion xd
1 Tested many cars including Sonata, Altima, Legacy, Accord.


scion xd
2 When I tried the Camry, everything went mute... it was an authentic pleasure driving this 2012 Camry SE, I tried every trim, and I kept coming back to the SE.


scion xd
1 I choose the Black Attitude interior with a Gray Metallic exterior, such a beautiful combination.No regrets, great gas savings, great comfort, and the most important thing...I enjoy every mile going by in the car odometer.


scion xd
2 By the way I drove from Maryland to Michigan on 1 tank of fuel, and still had plenty of gas for 2 more hours of driving.

2 Chose the 2012 Camry LE with 2.5 (4 cyl).

1 Only option I put on my LE was the 8 way power driver seat.

2 Rear passenger leg and shoulder room superb.


scion xd
1 Trunk space plenty.


scion xd
2 My wife loves to drive the vehicle though her car is a Buick Enclave, which she loves.


scion xd
2 Gas mileage is as advertised.


scion xd
2 In some cases I am getting better than the advertised 35mpg highway.


scion iq
2 I love the heated seats, cooled seats, heated steering wheel, power, power and more horsepower.


scion xd
2 Standard Bluetooth with smart phone connection and Pandora connection makes it safe for hands on driving and receiving/making a phone call.


scion xd
2 Only minor issue I have with the vehicle is sometimes water will drip off the side of trunk lid into the trunk compartment when you first open the trunk if the top of the trunk lid has water/dew on it.


scion xd
1 Also, wish the LE came with alittle darker window tint.


scion xd
1 I had that professionally installed after I purchased vehicle.

2 I have a 2012 Camry LE with 10k miles on it.


scion xd
1 This a great car.


scion xd
1 It has an EPA rating of 35 mpg highway, but I have been getting 38-41 Mpg consistantly on long trips.

2 I would suggest fold down seats in the floor, scotch guarded leather seats (especially for biege color seats) and sunroof improvements to prevent rattling/buffering noise when fully open.

1 The touch screen radio with blue tooth, USB and ipod jack is awesome.

2 I have been a Nissan owner for about ten years I owned two Pathfinders, a Maxima, and a Murano, and none of them compare to my new Camry XLE.


scion xd
1 I was ready to get away from Nissan, and I am really glad I did.


scion xd
2 After looking at the Honda Accord and CRV, and the Chevrolet Equinox, I chose to look at a Camry, not expecting to purchase one, I was so used to SUV's, I just knew the CRV was going to be my choice.


scion xd
1 It only took sitting in the driver's seat to know that this was my new baby.


scion xd
1 I absolutely LOVE it!


scion iq
1 I love this car styling is great, real head turner even when dirty.......its a real cruiser down peachtree st in HotAtlanta, GA.


scion xd
2 We took it on a road trip the day after we bought it and averaged about 38 miles to the gallon - quite a difference from the Pathfinder at 18 mpg.


scion xd
2 It is comfortable, smooth, and a joy to drive.


scion xd
2 I don't usually like to drive on our road trips, but I like the car so much I drove all the way back home.


scion xd
1 I love the fact that you just push a button to start it and that you touch the door handle to unlock the doors (as long as you have the remote).


scion xd
1 I had some trouble getting the Entune hooked up, but I think the kinks have been worked out on that.


scion xd
1 The Navigation system is not as user friendly as the Pathfinder's was, but I will eventually get used to it.


scion xd
2 The back up camera is clear.


scion xd
1 As soon as the blind spot monitoring device is available, I plan on taking the car back to the dealer to have that put in.


scion xd
1 It truly has all of the features of a luxury car, and I am so glad that I chose this over the other cars.


scion xd
1 I got many more features and accessories for the same amount of money compared to the Equinox, CRV, and Accord.


scion xd
1 Those that have written that if you drive it, you will buy it are telling the truth.

scion xd
1 I was never a Toyota fan until I drove the 2012 SE I4, the ride quality, smoothness, comfort, power, handling, fuel efficiency, and safety compares very favorably with the competition I tested.No left pull issues or limited outward rear visibility of the Optima / Sonata.


scion xd
1 No noisy cabin of an Accord and the Camry has a 6sp instead of the Honda's 5sp transmission.


scion xd
1 Statistically and historically the Camry is more reliable than the VW Passat.


scion xd
1 More room than a Nissan Altima especially in the rear seat.


scion xd
1 Made in the U.S. without the inconsistent quality and reliability issues of Ford, GM, or Chrysler vehicles.The Camry is definitely not perfect although overall it is a very refined, well-balanced, and safe car capable of obtaining the high fuel mileage of my much smaller Honda Civic."

2 The car feels sportier than Toyota Camry models of the past, but it's still no sports car.

1 I say "may" because Toyota has just a little work left to do with this generation.


scion xd
1 One complaint, both rear doors stick out away from the car ever so slightly from the front doors where they both meet at the bottom gap.


hyundai veracruz
2 Thus far I like the vehicle, I purchased the Luxury FWD model.


scion xd
1 From a car detailer point of view, this is an area, that if you're in the "salt belt", will be a point of contention years down the road.


scion xd
2 Maybe it's just on my car, and it is ever so slight, but it's worth mentioning.


scion xd
1 Guess a ride down to the dealer to compare with other Camry's is in order.


scion xd
2 Then again, I lease, so in 3 years it's out of my mind.Interior: has been totally reinvented and is outstanding!! Toyota answered the call from complaints of last generation's interior design and quality.


scion xd
2 Anything that gets touched under normal driving has been softened over last gen.


scion xd
1 Gone are the hard plastics, trim gaps, and odd exposed joints.


scion xd
1 New dash is nice, soft and pliable with "contrast stitching" that matches the seats.


scion xd
1 The seats in the SE are cloth and trimmed with Toyota's fake leather called "SofTex".


scion xd
2 It does the job, looks good, and is soft to the touch, but we'll have to see how it holds up over time.


scion xd
1 Also regarding the seats, Toyota added bigger side bolsters to keep your tush where it belongs without being too restrictive or invading, an excellent job by Toyota.


hyundai veracruz
1 So far the vehicle is really user friendly, has a great ride..


scion xd
1 Width (i.e. - knee space) up front has been improved due to redesigned front door panels.


scion xd
1 Rear legroom has been vastly improved by redesigned front seat placement and front seat backs.


scion xd
1 However, the rear deck is, oddly, carpeted.


scion xd
1 Seems like a bug and hair catcher to me, and sure enough already... it has been.


scion xd
1 Should have left even the hard plastic tray back here.


scion xd
1 Easier to clean, and looks better even when it's dirty.


scion xd
2 The seat belt pre-tensioners have finally been loosened up, a BIG WELCOME on long trips.


scion xd
2 My 2011 Sienna has same tight pre-tensioners ...uggghhh!!Ride / Handling / Powertrain: Toyota has softened the ride in the SE without sacrificing handling, amazing!


hyundai tucson
1 Dealer said mileage would improve after it's 'broken in'.


hyundai veracruz
1 There are some parts of the interior that look like leather but arent and I don't think Cadillac should have skimped on that.


scion xd
1 How Toyota did it, I don't know, I just like it.


scion xd
1 The transmission does still upshift abruptly (in order to increase mpg) and bogs down the engine when you're gentle on the pedal.


scion xd
2 However, being a little more aggressive with said pedal cancels this out, at a cost to mpg of course.


scion xd
1 There has got to be a sweet spot somewhere... maybe I'm not looking hard enough for it.


scion xd
1 Also, while on the highway, a slight depress of the pedal does NOT cause a quick, gas eating and whiny, downshift as before.


scion xd
1 If you DO want the downshift and some faster acquired mph you need to press that pedal a little deeper now.


scion xd
2 I'd rather have this type of system, my opinion.


scion xd
2 Gas mileage so far seems better (about 4-5 mpg better), maybe because car is allowed to coast to a stop and the, again, my opinion, improved highway downshifts.


hyundai veracruz
1 But for all of the features you can't beat the price.


scion xd
1 One complaint for under the hood, open it and you will see the ugly exhaust header with massive welds staring at you (something a car detailer like me notices).


scion xd
1 I know, it's under the hood, but still...


scion xd
2 I have seen a couple of competitors from Korea clad the under hood area nicely and neatly.


scion xd
1 Come on Toyota, this is your bread and butter car, keep it above the rest, and step up to the plate under the hood.


scion xd
1 Add both cladding and performance!Additions / Subtractions from 2010: Added touchscreen radio and bluetooth phone... a HUGE plus, Removed ALL windows Auto Up / Down feature (now just Driver is auto), Added heated side mirrors, Removed driver and passenger sill plate enhancements (Chrome "Camry" on 2010), Removed "chrome sport pedals" (no biggie, who looks at the pedals anyway?),


scion xd
1 Removed dual exhaust (it looked cool).Packages / Options: Unfortunately, you cannot get the Convenience Pkg.


scion xd
1 without having to buy the Entune / Navigation Pkg.


scion xd
1 I find MANY of the Convenience Pkg.


hyundai veracruz
1 I also looked at the Infinity FX35, BMW X3 and the Acura MDX and Cadillac seemed to be the best buy.


scion xd
1 I went without both.Overall:


scion xd
2 Although some options were removed and others added, this Camry is darn near perfect.


scion xd
2 Upgrades to the next generation should be 1) more powerful 4 cyl.

2 engine (this one is good, but we should get better without having to be "turbofied" like other cars), 2) give back options that were standard before, a very odd way of doing business in my opinion.

1 I won't waste space repeating all of the other accolades given the 2012 Camry.


scion xd
1 Just know that it is wonderful...the way it looks (I own the Barcelona Red LE), drives, handles, and gives good gas mileage.I looked at the Kia Optima, which I loved, the Hyundai Sonata, which looks a little too much like a Mercedes Benz copy, and the new VW 20T, but since I previously owned a 2007 Camry, and could trust its reliability, I opted for the Camry 2012, LE.I am generally a 6 cyl.


scion xd
1 driver because I like fast pickup and power driving; the 2012, 4 cyl Camry gives me all of that...and the paint job is fantastic.The CON that no one has mentioned, thus far, though, is the fact that there is no MANUAL KEY TRUNK LOCK!

2 The in-car iPhone hookup and nav is very nicely done, and I can spend hours getting to know the hybrid system and how to tweak my driving to max out mileage.When I have friends in the car, I just turn off the eco mode and they have all been impressed that a Camry has that much power.I have driven the Focus and a lot of other cars (I'm a National Car Rental ultra elite customer because I rent so much for work) and I can safely say that this Camry is probably your best bet for a fun, reliable drive that will keep its resale value and work with you to save gas.Features I like: Interior comfort, Entune, Navigation voice (she's much friendlier than others), hybrid displays, ride quality, trunk space.What I don't like: Outside styling could use some tweaking, the sunroof really hits you in the headroom department which is why I avoided it."

1 You have to realize this vehicle keeps its value because they don't make many of them, and its made for a specific market, offroading.


smart fortwo
2 If you have no intention on doing some trail driving, then you really don't have any business owning one.

2 After pondering this all day, I've decided I really do just love my FJ too much to part with it yet.

2 I've traded off vehicles just for the sake of having something new or different, but I'm realizing it would be foolish to get rid of something that has been so perfect for me.

2 A buddy just got a new Wrangler, and I personally think it's junk compared to my tight, squeak-and-rattle-free FJ.

2 My husband and I have had ours for a year now and love it so much we will pass it down to our kids.

1 The washable interior is perfect for kids and dogs and anything else you want to stick back there.


smart fortwo
1 The power is excellent as well.


smart fortwo
1 I towed a jeep cherokee laredo out of the snowy ditch, which no one thought I could do, and the FJ didn't even pause.

2 The vehicle is made to be upgraded with aftermarket parts.

1 The blind spot on the rear passenger side, the gas millage (16.5 city & 21 hwy), and the getting in and out of the back seats are the only down sides to the vehicle.

1 In any vehicle you have to be alert and pay attention.

2 I will agree with another reviewer though, the windshield is definitely a "bug magnet".

2 Replaced a fully loaded Ford Expedition and couldn't be happier!


smart fortwo
2 Both are four wheel drive and the mileage on the FJ is FAB compared to what I was getting!It's a fun vehicle to drive and you do get lots of attention on and off road with it.As for the blindspots-not a prob if you adjust your mirrors (I'm 5'3" and don't have a prob).


smart fortwo
2 I do however have two complaints relating to "comfort", I spend most of my day driving for work and the windshield frustrates the heck out of me!!

smart fortwo
2 I also think the center counsole could have been designed better...I love the fact that I have the jack for my ipod..but there's not really a good place to "set" it, I also think only having one power outlet in the console is a little "too retro" for 2007!Other than those few complaints, my raves for the FJ could go on and on!

2 Outside the minor visibility issues (I'm used to not seeing behind me when I pull a snowmobile tailer) the FJ does everything well.

2 Go drive one.


smart fortwo
1 My ONLY complaints are small ones, almost inconsequential for this vehicle (e.g., a bit too much plastic on the interior, OEM skid plates are a somewhat thin, OEM tires need to be real AT tires, slightly upgraded driver visibility needed, etc.)Nevertheless, the performance of this remarkable SUV, both on and off road, is unparalleled, even in stock form verses its competitors in stock form.


smart fortwo
1 Then, when upgraded with quality AT, XT, or MT tires (e.g., Big-O, Big Foot ATs or XTs), a 3" lift, and thicker, more comprehensive skid plates than the OEM ones, this vehicle becomes a most formidable offroad machine!


smart fortwo
1 Go for the gold by adding All Pro offroad bumpers, a Warn winch, All Pro rock rails, quality 33" or 35" XT or MT tires (e.g., Big-O, Big Foot XTs), and four-wheel drive onboard equipment (e.g., hilift jack, air compressor, shovel, recovery straps, tire repair kit, etc.), and this vehicle will take on trials like the Rubicon, Fordyce Creek, Poison Spider, Golden Spike, Lion's Back, etc., with confidence and enormus satisfaction!The FJ Cruiser is THE offroad vehicle of the 21st Century.


smart fortwo
1 You can't go wrong, whether you use it stock on the freeway or on moderate offroad trails or make various levels of upgrades, to your choice as loads of aftermarket material is available, and pleasantly pass the Jeeps in the "Classic Jeep Position" (hood up, driver bent over trying to figure out what's the matter) on the world's toughest offroad trails.

1 You don't even need a jack to change the oil, just crawl underneath and the top mounted oil filter makes it even easier.


suzuki grand-vitara
1 The futuristic styling speaks for itself, no other SUV on the road looks like it.


suzuki grand-vitara
2 Plenty of interior room although the back seats can get cramp for a long raod trip, you wouldn't want to sit back there for more than 4 hours.


suzuki grand-vitara
1 Fold-down the seats and there is ton of cargo room.


suzuki grand-vitara
2 Handles well in good/bad weather.


suzuki grand-vitara
1 Stock tires are just okay in snow, traction is not the best especially when stopping in snow.

2 However, the 4 wheel drive works fantastic in bad weather.

1 If you're constantly carting around more than 2 people, this may not be the best SUV for you.

1 No frills interior, rubber-lined floor makes for easy clean up especially in winter.

suzuki grand-vitara
2 You have to add something aftermarket just to feel as if there's anything on your lower back at all! Makes any long road trips challenging.

suzuki grand-vitara
2 I've owned other 4x4's and this vehicle is a very capable off-road vehicle.


suzuki grand-vitara
1 It will go places that will surprise the daylights out of you, even in stock form.


suzuki grand-vitara
2 With that said, it's independent front suspension keeps it out of the "extreme" off-road vehicle category.


suzuki grand-vitara
1 Because it isn't extreme, I believe the FJ is an excellent daily driver and still a very competent, weekend off-roader.The styling is unique and helps you stand out from the rest of the herd.


suzuki grand-vitara
1 The rear door is large with a pretty wide arc when opening.


suzuki grand-vitara
2 I usually don't have a problem in the grocery store parking lot, unless someone parks too close and I'm backed in.


suzuki grand-vitara
1 In those cases, the window will open upwards if you want to get access to that storage.

suzuki grand-vitara
1 They can be overcome by properly aiming the mirrors.


suzuki grand-vitara
2 I've driven pickup's, panel vans and other vehicles with no windows, so I have no problem seeing other cars or backing up.

2 The back-up sensors work very well and even alert on small things like short bushes or shrubs.


suzuki grand-vitara
1 Very cool!In stock form, comfort is outstanding.


suzuki grand-vitara
2 The stance is aggressive and the ride is very car-like.


suzuki grand-vitara
1 It has a more comfortable/plush ride than many cars I've owned.


suzuki grand-vitara
1 There is a bit of body roll if you corner aggressively, but the vehicle is rock-solid stable.


suzuki grand-vitara
1 Aftermarket shocks and struts will firm up the ride nicely and move the ride quality from "luxury" to "sports car".In stock form, performance and gas mileage is pretty good for this class of vehicle.

suzuki grand-vitara

suzuki grand-vitara
2 The truck also rattles to death, it is full of cheap loose plastic parts and you can never find which one is making the rattle, the dealer couldn't find it either!


suzuki grand-vitara
1 The seats offer no lumbar support at all and it has no center console, so take it easy on turns or it will throw you out of your seat.


suzuki grand-vitara
1 The alternative is to get the arm rests which help a tad bit, not much.... and yes, Toyota will charge you extra for them!


suzuki grand-vitara
1 It isn't as rough of a ride as you would think, but if you live around uneven pavements, it will make you feel them.Also, don't plan on putting anyone in the back seat unless they are a small child, because if you are above 5 foot 8, you will have to put the seat back so far that no regular sized person can sit behind you.


suzuki grand-vitara
1 They also have some odd bending to do to get into the suicide doors without hitting their head on the latch that holds it.As far as MPG goes, I've heard countless people claim 17 to 23 MPG!


suzuki grand-vitara
2 I don't know how they drive, but I have never gotten more than 14 and it takes premium fuel, so I have never filled the tank for less than $65!


suzuki grand-vitara
2 It comes standard with an AUX input for iPod's, this is one of the few things Toyota did right, works like a charm!The stereo itself is decent, it's made by Toyota.

2 The max volume is set at 80, but if you go above 40, it gets so high pitched that it will make your ears bleed, and you can fool with the controls all you want, but it will never be perfect, but it is still much better than some of the competitors!Another disappointment is the overall size.


suzuki grand-vitara

2 The headliner gets soaked any time it rains more than a half inch.


suzuki grand-vitara
2 The floor mats are rubber and sit on a slick plastic surface, Toyota for some reason, did not see a reason to put any sort of latch on these mats, and they often slide under the pedals.In all, if I were looking for a year round vehicle for occasional towing/hauling, I wouldn't buy this vehicle again."

1 I bought the FJ last year at this time, thinking it was different and was told it had all kinds of capabilities.


suzuki grand-vitara
1 What I have found that the capabilities that are shared during the sales experience will most likely never happen, "Fording 28 inches of water" really!


suzuki grand-vitara
1 It's rolling box, that gets terrible gas mileage, it is not user friendly at all, sight lines are awful, I can't begin to tell you how many time I have almost hit someone in the blind spots.


suzuki grand-vitara
1 The interior is not at all user friendly, and its really noisy inside, and getting things in and out of the back seat, even with the small doors is nearly impossible.


suzuki grand-vitara
2 The single piece door is heavy and bulky, again making it almost useless.


suzuki grand-vitara
2 I have had to replace 4 TPWS sensors, and the light just came on again.

2 It was a long process of researching which vehicle was the right one for us.


suzuki grand-vitara
2 Considering our budget and the desire to have a safe vehicle we narrowed down to three: Honda Pilot, Subaru Tribeca, Toyota Highlander.


suzuki grand-vitara
1 Honda Pilot was too bulky and it was a bit awkward parking the vehicle.


suzuki grand-vitara
2 We liked all the safety features, the drive was pleasant, but it was just too bulky and the parking was an issue.


suzuki grand-vitara
1 Subaru Tribeca was fun to drive.


suzuki grand-vitara
2 We like the safety features, had a lot of control driving, it had a car like feel, but it was too difficult finding the right model and package.


suzuki grand-vitara
2 So we decided to buy the Toyota Highlander (SE, 4wd).


suzuki grand-vitara
2 It had the safety features we were looking for, the drive was pleasant, felt like driving a Camry but sat higher, and it came with the 4wd with snow option.


suzuki grand-vitara
2 The SE model came with a lot of extra features like blue tooth, moon roof, power tailgate, garage door opener, leather seats with seat warmers, dual-climate control (front/back), back-up camera, and auto-dim rearview mirror.


suzuki grand-vitara
2 It also felt very luxurious in the cabin.

2 Though rated at 24 highway I have achieved 26 on more than one trip.

suzuki grand-vitara
1 If you lack the ability to begin slowly you're not going to like this car in the snow, but most will find the car to be more than adequate.The optional navigation system does a good job, but is way too expensive to keep up to date.All in all I really enjoy this car and recommend it highly."

suzuki sx4

2 It is the most quiet car I've ever owned, and handles like you're driving a car.


suzuki sx4
2 The ride is smooth and it absorbs bumps really well.The negatives - The standard radio is not bad, but it's not great.


suzuki sx4
1 I would also point out that the acceleration on the highway could use a little more umph.


suzuki sx4
1 If you're driving 55 and punch it to get around traffic, there is a slight delay.


suzuki sx4
1 Though the car has plenty of power, for some reason, it does drag just a touch in this situation.


suzuki sx4
1 It is not something that would prevent me from buying it again, but something I would mention in case you test drive.


suzuki sx4
1 Lastly, when the 3rd row seat is in use, there is very little space left in the rear for luggage.


suzuki sx4
1 With the 3rd row down, there is more space than you'll ever need.If you're looking to buy, check out the SE model.

1 Changing from driving a regular gasoline engine to a hybrid takes zero time to get used to.


suzuki sx4
1 The vehicle behaves the exact same to a driver as a "normal" vehicle.

1 When you are stopped at a stoplight or stop sign or traffic jam, your engine is off and you burn zero gasoline, but all your stuff stays on (radio, air conditioner, heater, etc.).

suzuki sx4
1 Over the past year, we have consistently gotten about 29 mpg in the CITY, and less (let's say around 25) on the highway.

1 On the highway you basically only burn gasoline, and wind resistance is very high at high speeds, hence the difference.

suzuki sx4
2 The ride in the Highlander can not be beat.


suzuki sx4
1 We looked at every and I do mean every other SUV in this price range and none of them could beat the Highlander.


suzuki sx4
1 I read on one of the reviews that the Navigation System locks when the car is moving and the review said don't waste your money, I beg to differ it is a safety feature that I love, you shouldn't be fooling around with your Navigation when you are moving and the Nav on the Highlander is awesome.

suzuki sx4
1 The one thing I don't care for it is that the rear hatch is difficult to pull down.


suzuki sx4
2 You have to pull on it with both hands, so it isn't very efficient for having full hands, which I normally do!


suzuki sx4

suzuki sx4
2 I traded in this 06 for a 08 Highlander AWD and I was surprised at how differently they operate.


kia optima
1 I have all the whistles & bells including ultra-vista roof.


suzuki sx4
1 I live in a rural community where the roads are not paved so I get the chance to use the SUV in a number of driving conditions.


suzuki sx4
1 The steering on the 08 is very touchy and had to get use to its light touch as the 06 you could "feel" the turns.


suzuki sx4
1 The power on the 08 is ridiculous I have to watch my foot with this puppy the 06 wasn't to shabby neither going up and down the Colorado mountains.


suzuki sx4
1 Gas mileage definitely goes to the 06.


suzuki sx4
2 I achieved a constant 23mpg on this V6 awd and on the 08 the best I've gotten so far is 21.5mpg.


suzuki sx4
2 However it is said that once you hit 6K miles the gas mileage gets better so will have to wait and see how that turns out.


suzuki sx4
1 As far as the snow the 06 in my opinion does a better job than the 08 I think due to the light touch steering as stated earlier the slightest touch yields huge results on the 08.


suzuki sx4
2 Had only 1 problem with the 08 went to pull my phone charger out of the 12v socket and the whole piece came up in my hand.


suzuki sx4
1 This was easily fixed by shoving it back into the console.


suzuki sx4
2 Finally, I really enjoy the size and ride of the 08 and the spacious surroundings in the vehicle itself.

suzuki sx4

suzuki sx4
1 While it's no power house, the little thing will make the vehicle scoot when you're in a hurry and it cruises very nicely thanks to the 6 speed transmission.


suzuki sx4
2 We live out in the country and commute to a big hospital for work and take the kids to and from ball practice.


suzuki sx4
2 A lot of rolling hills and curvy terrain, and while the suspension is a little soft for my liking, my girlfriend loves it, as do the kids.It's surprisingly roomy, and I'm a big guy (haven't tried to crawl in the very back yet).


suzuki sx4
1 There is a rear-area climate control, which the kids enjoy, and the folding third row seats can come up one at a time, meaning each kid gets their own seat with one of the seats in the back folded down to make room for ball equipment, backpacks and homework, etc.It doesn't have a lot of the features of the considerably more expensive version, nor much of the "umph" of that V-6.

2 I traded a 2003 Camry V6 for my 2008 4WD Highlander Sport after test driving a 2008 Honda Pilot twice (the Highlander ride is better), and a 2008 Ford Taurus wagon (cheap plastic interior).


suzuki sx4
1 I also noticed that the Highlander has much better rear axle ground clearance than the Pilot, so I know it would be better on light off-road use.


suzuki sx4
2 As I did with my V6 Camry, I find the Highlander engine runs better using premium fuel.


kia optima
1 It has great highway power and seems to even improve after it has been driven a few miles.


suzuki sx4
1 I hasten to add that they both ran fine on regular, but I'm a spirited driver and I can sense the better performance - especially when accelerating hard and driving on steep hills (there is less down shifting when on cruise control).


suzuki sx4
1 The third row meant nothing to me so they're folded down and I like the resulting cargo area.


suzuki sx4
1 It's wonderful to be able to load groceries, etc., without bending.

2 As expected, the Highlander rides much nicer than the RAV4.A couple of negatives: I owned the Sport model which had 19" wheels.


suzuki sx4
1 The OEM tires were supposed to last only 30-35k miles.

2 This is simply stated and in my opinion the single most dangerous vehicle I have ever driven in the snow in the last 27 years.


suzuki sx4
1 My 2wd 64 chevy pickup handled better in the snow.


suzuki sx4
1 The technology associated with this vehicle is very intrusive.


suzuki sx4
2 The vehicle stability system cannot be turned off, and the moment a tire slips in the snow it starts locking up brakes.


suzuki sx4
1 Really hard to control a vehicle when the vehicle ensures all 4 tires are locked up and sliding without your foot on the brake.

suzuki sx4
1 It is roomy and comfy.


suzuki sx4
1 Gas Mileage is unreal!


suzuki sx4
1 And it isn't a hybrid either.


suzuki sx4
1 The only thing with Toyota's and my husband has the tundra, is when you try to roll down the window, it makes such a loud (rumbling) noise, you can't dare ride with windows cracked or down.


suzuki sx4
2 Not sure what the problem is with Toyato and that ability.


suzuki sx4
1 My Ford Explorer never had those issues.


suzuki sx4
2 Another thing I do not like is the back window is much smaller so it is hard to see out the back.


suzuki sx4
2 I do not trust the back up camera, so I like to turn and look back and with the huge seats and tiny back window, well you can't see much.


kia optima
1 It's very underpowered with a 6 speed auto transmission that jerks as it changes gears, and jerks as you slow down.


suzuki sx4
2 So I would suggest a much bigger window back there.


suzuki sx4
1 Also the blue tooth is terrible.


suzuki sx4
1 I don't even use it anymore.


suzuki sx4
1 There is a terrible delay in talking.


suzuki sx4
1 People can't hear me, they say it sounds like I"m in a hole.


suzuki sx4
1 Even if I stop the car and sit in a parking lot, I can't have a converstation, because of the delay (like talking on walkie-talkies) and they are not able to hear me well enough.


suzuki sx4
1 So I say Fix the bluetooth to a better system, bigger back window and the arrow dynamtic or whatever it is - that will allow me to drive with the windows down and not have a ear drum deafing THUMPING sound in the car."

suzuki sx4
1 I like the 3rd row option but there isn't much storage behind the 3rd row seat when it's up.


suzuki sx4
1 We could never use the 3rd row for a long road trip because there wouldn't be any room for luggage, etc.


suzuki sx4
2 But for a trip around town with friends or extra kids the 3rd row is perfect.The only flaw I can think of is the 3rd row isn't a split seat, but this doesn't matter much to us (others may mind it though).


suzuki sx4
1 Also, the "switch out" middle seat in the 2nd row has it's pros and cons.


suzuki sx4
2 If you plan on having 2 pasengers in the 2nd row most of the time, the 2 captain chairs back are very comfortable, and the option of putting the table between them is great, but if you have 3 kids and plan on putting all 3 of them in the 2nd row often, you may want to look for an SUV with a regular bench in the 2nd row.


suzuki sx4
2 The middle seat is a bit tight, but it's fine if only used once in a while.It is excellent in the snow and we feel so safe driving it in New England winters.Overall I am so happy with this car, and can't wait to continue to drive it for years to come!" 3 people out of 4 found this review helpful

kia optima
1 I just picked-up a FWD luxury edition with the navagation package in tri-coat red.It is a gorgeous color!So far the car has been great.The bluetooth and the navagation system are great toys and also make driving very easy.


suzuki sx4
2 When I brought the car in to have the tailgate fixed, I was treated poorly and dismissed as the service techs could not replicate the problem.


suzuki sx4
1 I brought the car in three times to have this looked at only to be told all was normal...even after it opened on the road.


suzuki sx4
1 Finally, as I was leaving the service shop for the 4th time, the tailgate did not function properly.


suzuki sx4
1 Toyota reluctantly agreed to replace the locking mechanism.


suzuki sx4
2 Interestingly enough, I have not had the problem since.


suzuki sx4
1 In my opinion the build/material quality is pretty poor/cheap for the cost of the vehicle and the All Wheel Drive system is a joke.

suzuki sx4
1 Trucks are tough.

1 Trucks can tow heavy loads safely.


suzuki sx4
2 Trucks can be lifted (mine is, lifted 3") and run 33" tires and have 13" of clearance under the rear axel casing.

suzuki sx4
1 Trucks have real four wheel drive systems.


suzuki sx4
2 Trucks can have winches (mine does, thanks to the Austrian Outback).


suzuki sx4
1 My point is, there are not many vehicles left in the world that can go from the highway to some of the roughest jeep trails in Colorado, hauling 8 people and doing it with comfort and quite.


suzuki sx4
1 The Land Cruiser is truly remarkable because of it's versatility, on road and off.


suzuki sx4
1 It looks big, but it's really not.


suzuki sx4
2 Only 1.5" wider than a Jeep.


suzuki sx4
2 Only 12" longer than the 4 Runner.


suzuki sx4
2 With a lift kit and replacement bumpers from ARB, the LC can out do Jeeps in rocks and shelfs.


suzuki sx4

suzuki sx4
1 There are also many modification kits available.

2 Sad day when the old SUV was involved in a hit and run causing it to be destroyed...had planned on driving it for a lot longer.


suzuki sx4
1 Considered a new Tahoe or Yukon but they seemed to be of lesser quality with more plastic and for the price of $50,000, I found that offensive.

suzuki sx4
1 I chose the correct car for the adjustment.


suzuki sx4
1 I really tried hard not to like the car, but I really like it.


suzuki sx4
2 It has very good "get up and go" for when you need to get onto a busy freeway or for passing someone.


suzuki sx4
2 I like how it handles.


suzuki sx4
2 The AWD on wet, sometimes a few inches of water covered roads plus the stability/traction control were options I'm glad this car has.


suzuki sx4
2 Some people may not feel the amount of gas it uses justifies the option, but it does for me when it comes to safety since I'm in a very wet climate.I think it gets good gas mileage, but I had a V8 so I'm probably not the best judge of that.


kia optima
2 I use to pay more to fill up my honda truck.


suzuki sx4
1 I'm sure there are cars that get better mileage, but for the options and features that this car has, you'd probably have to pay a lot more in a small SUV or other wagon.Now the best part, it's a small wagon!


suzuki sx4
2 I never thought I'd be excited to own a "station wagon", but it's really nice.


suzuki sx4
1 The seats lay all the way down flat and you can put pretty much anything back there.


suzuki sx4
1 Even dogs and stuff you have to buy for everyday life.


suzuki sx4
1 It has little hooks to hook grocery bags to so that your stuff doesn't go rolling everywhere (genius!) and it even has a place to tie bigger things down if you move the removable carpet/mat.

2 It's not something you can see unless you're driving and want to look in the vanity mirror.


suzuki sx4
1 It's just an uncovered mirror now.


suzuki sx4
2 And, since I bought it used, there's a piece of plastic that keeps coming loose (easily snapped back into place) between the front door/back door and the frame.


suzuki sx4
1 Hard to describe the location, but it's right under where the seat belt joins to the car frame.


suzuki sx4
2 I'm sure if I took the time to jiggle it into place properly or see if it needs to be screwed in or something, it's just not that big of a deal and I'm always in a hurry so if it happens to pop out, I just pop it back into place.


suzuki sx4
2 Like I said, I bought it used, so it's probably something the former driver banged out of place and never got screwed back in.Anways, I like the car.


suzuki sx4

1 This Prius Plug-In was about 7-8K more than a conventional Prius, but I get way better MPG, a tax break, and I can drive in the carpool lane solo.There are a lot of efficiency displays, and I'll admit that it's like a slightly addictive video game to try to keep the Prius in the most efficient zone.


volkswagen beetle
1 Then you get a payoff when you turn off the car and see that you've gotten 80+ MPG!!Even the base-level PlugIn has all the extras: touchscreen with Navi, heated seats, bluetooth integration to cell and iPod, backup camera, push-button start, "smart" key that stays in your pocket.It's surprisingly roomy (I'm 6' 3") and can even fit my teenager and a friend in the back.Charging is easier than I had thought.

hyundai veracruz

volkswagen beetle
1 You can Update the apps as they evolve.

1 Purchased my 2011 Prius II brand new.


volkswagen beetle
1 Smooth ride, quiet (love sneaking up on people in electric mode), excellent brakes that have saved me from an accident several times, and no maintenance except oil changes every 5k miles.


volkswagen beetle
1 My gas milage in eco mode during winter months is about 47-50mpg.


volkswagen beetle
1 Summer brings milage around 55-64mpg.


volkswagen beetle
2 My commute is mostly back roads and some highway.

2 I was a bit apprehensive about purchasing a new vehicle b/c my vehicle(a Chevy Trailblazer) had just been paid off.


volkswagen beetle
1 That's great when you think about it, but I was horrified!


volkswagen beetle
2 ;)I've never had any electric or engine troubles.


volkswagen beetle
1 Everything is holding together well, even though we live up a 1/2 mile gravel driveway that gets pretty rough.


volkswagen beetle
1 There is a slight rattle coming from the little shelf thing in the center console, but that can be easily fixed with a small piece of felt.


volkswagen beetle
1 One of my main complaints is the interior plastics which scratch easily.


volkswagen beetle
1 I have the tan interior which doesn't show scratches as much as the grays.


volkswagen beetle
2 The button and knob quality is fine, the issue is with door panels and dash.


volkswagen beetle
1 Another issue is the seat shape.


volkswagen beetle
1 While they're not exactly uncomfortable, a few small changes could make a world of difference.When comparing the Prius to the other cars I mentioned, I found that unless you're paying close to $30k, the interiors aren't going to give the expensive feel.

volkswagen touareg

volkswagen touareg
1 I like the way this car is ergonomically designed where everything is easy for the driver to access.


volkswagen touareg

volkswagen touareg

volkswagen touareg
2 .My big issue is with the Programming of the Bluetooth Telephone system.


volkswagen touareg
2 Here is what I wrote to Toyota a few minutes ago.


volkswagen touareg
2 I thought the complaints on the internet were just by people who like to gripe... not true, they do exist: .I bought a 2013 Prius about a month ago and I like the car .... except for the programming of the features ....


volkswagen touareg
1 In general there is a pervasive problem that appears to be long running with no action taking place.... your website has problems, your customer service has a reluctance to discuss an issue with the navigation, and there are numerous problems with the phone system that are all over the forums on the internet (going back ten years) and that I am experiencing as well.


volkswagen touareg
1 Apparently Toyota has no plans to fix them because it has been going on for so many years .... phone numbers double transferring from the cell phone, no way to edit, no way to delete, no way to shut off the phone app once it starts, no way to shut off the navigation once it starts, and others .... these ones in particular annoy me... Question .. Can you tell me why these exist, why you have not fixed them, and if there is any plan to fix them?" 7 people out of 7 found this review helpful

volkswagen touareg
2 Wouldn't even take apart and reassemble the dash on a new car under warranty with multiple customer complaints.


volkswagen touareg
1 With more online research I uncovered I wasn't alone, and toyotas refusal to help me in this situation has resolved me to sell this car and buy a 3 series BMW.


volkswagen touareg
1 Be extremely weary of cars starting prices, if they are low the build quality will always be poor.


volkswagen touareg
2 You can add expensive electronics, different engines, and better seats, but the interior design and plastics will always be the same.


volkswagen touareg

volkswagen touareg
1 The lowest I did was 44MPG during winter on the highway, but I have a lead food and liked keeping the car in "power mode" so you could do better if you stick with the speed limit.


volkswagen touareg
1 This car was a nice gas sipper, but the materials Toyota used were cheap feeling and not very durable.


volkswagen touareg
1 The cloth seats wrinkled, the hard plastics scratched extremely easily.


volkswagen touareg
2 I was always so scared I would mess up my dashboard with just a touch of a fingernail.


volkswagen touareg
2 The worst things about the car were the awful seats.


volkswagen touareg
2 They had little support in the back, and an old back injury I had actually started acting up and came back...I had to go back to physical therapy.


volkswagen touareg
2 The seats are in a leaned-forward position, and I could never rest my head back and be totally comfortable in my neck and back.


volkswagen touareg
2 I loved the gas savings, but other than the storage area and the nice radio and bluetooth connectivity, the car wasn't worth sacrificing my physical comfort and back for.


volkswagen touareg
2 I gave up the Pri a little over a week ago and got into a cheaper, much more comfortable albeit smaller vehicle.

1 I am now in that car, a 2009 Honda Civic LX, and I just love it.


volkswagen touareg
1 It's smooth and peppy and gets great gas mileage for a compact car.


volkswagen touareg
1 My 36mpg is not comparable to the 51mpg with the old Prius, but oddly enough I fill up once every 7-8 days, which is what I was doing in the Prius...though I think that has to do with the fact that my tank is bigger in the Civic and I do mostly highway driving.


volkswagen touareg
1 I could probably do more stop and go traffic in the Prius.


volkswagen touareg
1 Anyway, I'm getting off point.


volkswagen touareg
2 I recommend the Prius if you want to save gas $ and like cargo capacity and don't mind being a little uncomfortable, but the car will beat you up on long road trips...I took a 1300+ mile trip in it, and it was rough after a few hours.

volkswagen touareg
1 With the Performance Plus package, my Prius 2 corners like a snake without the body pitching back and forth after a turn.

1 To save gas, the "Game" now is retain more speed (kinetic energy) on corners when safe (where children, pedestrians, bikers, etc. are not around) and surface conditions safely permit.

2 The stiffer springs and short side wall tires do create a firmer ride but I like it.

volkswagen jetta
1 In the past 2 days, I have gotten the average miles per gallon to over 45 MPG, and it's still going up!!! Portland has many different elevation levels, and so going up and down the hills had me a bit hesitant to go hybrid, but this car has NO shortage of power from what I can see either on the freeway/hills/on-ramps from what I can see at this point.


volkswagen jetta
1 I am getting a clear bra installed today at the factory which I think will be a worthy investment to protect the great looking front end.


volkswagen jetta
2 The car has a smooth ride, the handling feels good, and the steering is very easy to drive without it feeling like you're driving a big ol' boat.


volkswagen jetta
2 I had read people commenting about the rearward visibility being an issue, personally, I think the rear visibility is fantastic, and I'm actually glad I didn't go for the navigation/rear-view camera.


volkswagen jetta
2 The bluetooth system works VERY well, and has a caller ID feature that scrolls across the radio screen, I also like the fact that I can control the stereo (the JBL is great by the way), answer/disconnect my iPhone, adjust the display screen AND change the temperature all without taking my hands off the wheel!!! Also I do like the fact the outlet to charge my phone is beneath the shift console as it does discourage me from doing any texting while driving, there is another outlet along with the iPod connector hidding away in the center console so it's out of sight.


volkswagen jetta
1 Mine also came with the clear rear bumper applique to protect the back end while loading/unloading the car which I would highly recommend as well.I may still be in the honeymoon stage, but at this point, I don't see any reason why one shouldn't consider a Prius as their next car, but if that changes, I will put it on here."

2 If you get the PriusIV, the hatch door also has a sensor to unlock it but on the others it doesn't.

2 At over $24K for this car it is unbelievable those two items were not included from the factory.


volkswagen jetta
2 The car lacks day time running lights and a locking storage area or any kind, both once again should be included at this price.


volkswagen jetta
1 The mpg goes down about 10mpg in cold weather so if you live far north you will not average 50+ year around.


volkswagen jetta
1 The EV mode is a joke and not ever useful.The display that sits in the center of the car is too dim in bright sunlight to see and lacks a lot of useful information.


volkswagen jetta
1 There is no warning light or sounds when you run low on gas and no way to see if your car if overheating.The rear visibility due to the split rear window it absolutely terrible.


volkswagen jetta
1 The dealer told me I would get used to it after a couple weeks but no one I know has.


volkswagen jetta
2 You can get a far superior set of mats from WeatherMaster for under $150.The hard plastics used all over the interior scratch easily and add to the cheap feel.


kia optima
1 The styling is good, and the ride and handeling is outstanding.The Bose radio sound is excellent, and the fact that On Star is able to download onto the nav system is an improvement.On the down side, the trunk is small compared to the DTS, the glove box houses the CD player, so the only thing that will fit into it is a pair of gloves.The CUE system presents a learning curve, and I find that some times I have to touch the screen several times to complete a function, and it is distracting while driving.The Heads Up function is a great feature,along with the blind spot feature and back up camera.I have called Cadillac several times and have found them to be helpful and wanting to help in any way they can." 8 people out of 8 found this review helpful

2 The fabric used on the seats is cheap and I am concerned it will not wear well over time.

1 The Prius takes some getting used to as it's obviously not a typical car.


volkswagen jetta
2 In mixed driving thus far, I've averaged right at 50mpg which astounds me, still.PROS: The MPG, obviously.

1 As a serial buyer of Acuras and Hondas, this household has finally found a true flagship worthy of the term.Purchase process was fairly good.


kia optima
2 Having been a regular Cadillac owner over the last 25 years, I waited patiently for this car to go into production after it was promised for the summer of 2010.


volkswagen jetta
1 The seamless EV/gas toggle with no hesitation also amazes me, even when starting from the downside of a hill, the Prius kicks in and propels you forward without hesitation.CONS: Opening and shutting the doors sounds of cheap construction but they're okay, just not as solid as I would like.


volkswagen jetta
1 I had leather installed from the aftermarket on the upholstery because that faux synthetic stuff in the upgraded Prius Four felt phony.


volkswagen jetta
2 No power seat though and do wish for it as finding the right driving position with the 6 way manual adjustments hasn't yet found me comfortable.


volkswagen jetta
1 The Entune system is still a mystery to me although I don't think I'd use it anyway but you would think the interfacing between smartphone and the car unit would be more user friendly.At first, the view out the back window was daunting to overcome but using side mirrors and getting accustomed to the look back there has vastly improved my driving of the car.SUMMING UP: The Prius is a marvel of a car.


volkswagen jetta
1 I love it in spite of the various issues cited earlier."


volkswagen jetta
2 Wife and I made the purchase after deciding to downsize from two car to one.


volkswagen jetta
1 We had several cars in mind, from the TSX wagon, to the BMW 3 series wagon.


volkswagen jetta
2 But in the end, we circled back and bought the V the same night we took the test drive.


volkswagen jetta
2 The car is the right size, not too big like some of the minivans out there(they should take out the mini part), and bigger than your standard Prius.


kia optima
1 Well that didn't happen until the summer of 2012, but it was worth the wait.I took deliver in late August, and the wait was worth it.

1 Living in Southern California, we have taken our V to Las Vegas, Palm Springs, Jousha Tree, and last but not least, Disneyland.


volkswagen jetta
2 We purchased the V 5, and have to say everything that came with the package, from the seats to the xeon headlights are just overall wonderful.

volkswagen jetta
1 I drive the Southern California freeways and I have no problem entering the freeways, passing uphill, or stepping "on it" and passing at higher speeds when necessary.As a matter of fact, you almost have to drive dragging your foot on the ground to keep from driving too fast!!I've seen comments about the "Prius rear view."


kia optima
1 The engine delivers in two ways, it gets you up and going as you drive, and the mileage is excellent for this size car...averaging 18.9 MPG in stop and go city driving.

volkswagen jetta
2 It is a different way of driving but it doesn't take long to get used to it (maybe 1-2 days) We generally fill up with gas when we are down to 1/4 tank.

1 Everytime we went to look at other vehicles and we told dealers we were looking at a couple of different cars, every time, and i mean every time, they would say the prius won't get the gas mileage here (because of our terrain) that they advertise.

volkswagen jetta
1 Other rattles in plastic panels may come and go.The car does not feel steady, solid and reassuring on the freeway.

1 So with the present Battery Pack, the EV modeis just a marketing Ploy.


volkswagen jetta
1 The new hybrid Lexus 250H has the same EV Mode.The Car has plenty of room front and rear, limited luggage space under the hatch.Visibility is limited and annoying when changing lanes, especially with all the seat head rests on the passenger seat and the rear seats.


volkswagen jetta
1 Steering wheel adjustments are very usefulThe Green uni-Color or monochrome Dashboard display is a real disappointment.It shows a lack of creativity on the part of Toyota engineers when it comes to dashboards.You can't distinguish mpg meter from Fuel level based on color.When you run low on fuel, no red light comes on and no recurring sound reminders are heard.The HYBRID display portion is user unfriendly and confusing to navigate through.It works as a rollodex that moves only forward from one display to another.Interior Cloth material is subpar and does not appear snuggly fit around the seatsCreeses appear here and there, be prepared to use seat covers.The 2009 PRIUS Cloth feels of higher quality than the 2010.I've compared the mpg with a friend's 2009 PRIUS.

1 The colorful dashboard display feedback is much more useful than what you see in the PRIUS.


volkswagen jetta
1 I was unwilling to pay over 28K for the FUSION to get around 34mpg.The PRIUS II is a basic imperfect transportation vehicle with the bare necessities.Purchasing the higher Package levels from $26k to $35K would be a waste of money in my opinion.Compared to a manual five speed transmission vehicle, the PRIUS is not a fun vehicle to drive.The car is in charge , The computer decides how the hybrid system functions.You won't see an RPM meter and you won't even see the coolant temperature gage.So I guess I won't know if it is overheating until the computer decides to shut down the engine.Hello AAA !!" 69 people out of 79 found this review helpful

1 Three years ago, we test drove a Prius but we didn't like it.


volkswagen jetta
1 It was noisy on highway and the cargo size was something between small and medium.During the last 4 months, I test drove Ford Fiesta, Ford Focus (Sedan), Nissan Versa, Hyndi Elantra and Accent, and Honda Fit and Civic.Ford Fiesta has a small backseat but unfriendly dashboard, however the dive was better than Honda Fit; more horsepower with a better dynamic.

1 Kudos to Cadillac on being on top of their game all around.


volkswagen jetta
1 Even though it looks like Versa offers a bigger space, its interior was not as sporty and as live as other cars and the power was comparable to Prius C. Both Elantra and Versa are quite powerful with more interior option at a lower cost but the rear view was not good at all.Compared to Fiesta and Focus, Prius C offers a bigger backseat, smoother drive, less road noise, a much better interior, almost no blind-spot, and more options (Bluetooth and automatic climate control with air filter for all trims).


volkswagen jetta
1 I really like the drive; much better than the original Prius that we test drove 3 years ago.


volkswagen jetta
1 The Prius C cargo space is smaller than all other cars but if you buy one for what it's built for --City, you don't need that much of cargo space.


volkswagen jetta
1 I have gotten up to 70mpg in city and an average of 54.


volkswagen jetta
1 Such a high mpg is due to a small engine; nonetheless, The power is good enough to get you on highways and turn fas on the road crosses.


volkswagen jetta
2 It's better to have the right amount of power than to have too much of it and that's why you can save money in long run.


volkswagen jetta
2 According to my calculations and considering EPA mpg and available discounts for above cars, 5-years cost to own of Fiesta or Focus were just couple of hundred cheaper than Prius C's (gas price = $4), so it all depends if you need more power or you think that the gas price will go higher and you want to save couple of hundreds.In general, I am very happy with my choice."

1 About a week before working a 70+ hour work week due to a job change, and moving into a job where a reliable vehicle is a must, my 2005 Subaru Impreza Outback died on the Interstate.


volkswagen routan
1 Some words of wisdom from family, friends, and coworkers got me at least considering the idea of purchasing a new car (my Subaru has never died on me and I will still say that it was worth it to put the money into it... but...).


volkswagen routan
2 I got out and started looking at all of my different options.


volkswagen routan
1 I looked at new cars, used cars, then finally decided to take a look at some hybrids since they are so economical.

1 Storage space, door pockets, center consoles-front and back-,and the glove compartment are way to small.

2 The Prius C blew me away.


volkswagen routan
2 It's cuter than a full-sized Prius and it's a car I'm not embarrassed to drive.


volkswagen routan
1 While there are some downsides: the dash and driver's cup holder being awkwardly placed to the point that a drink will "bump" the dash when you put it into the cup holder, the seats are a little hard, and the car does not have as much get-up-and-go as I would have liked... plus they don't make hybrids in a manual version.


volkswagen routan
2 However, I have learned to overcome all of these and am extremely happy with my choice.


volkswagen routan
1 I tilt drinks ever so slightly, purchased some cushioned seat covers, and have learned to enjoy the ease of an automatic transmission.


volkswagen routan
2 When paired with my killer gas mileage, quick maneuvering capabilities (hello amazing parallel parker!), and the fact that the car can definitely keep up on the highway or around town, I believe I made a wonderful choice and have not regretted it once in the few weeks that I've owned this gem of a vehicle.


volkswagen routan
2 Plus... it's so quiet that sometimes I feel like it's not even running."

1 Our daily round commute is about 15 miles (20-30% highway) and our combined mpg is 56.


volkswagen routan
2 The lowest and highest mpg in a 6.5 mile driving in 'Eco Mode' have been 45 and 92 respectively.


volkswagen routan
1 The mpg is greatly affected by driving behavior and outdoor temperature.

2 About all you can get into the glove compartment is one folded map and a menu or two.


volkswagen routan
1 The mpg drops in very hot days even if you don't turn on the A/C.

1 I used to think that the car is slow but actually it can keep up with speed of other cars on roads and highways.


volkswagen routan
2 I figured that if I want to experience a sporty drive, it will be cheaper to rent a car for a road trip.There are some small things that can be improved.


volkswagen routan
2 Some people don't like its exterior but I really don't care about how it looks in others' eyes.


volkswagen routan
2 I always want to enjoy my own driving and small things inside the car matter to me.


volkswagen routan
1 The inside can be improved in terms of material quality.


volkswagen routan
1 If you move the front seats very close to the dashboard, you can easily scratch your bare legs if rubbed against the plastic.


volkswagen routan
1 Besides, it's somehow uncomfortable that to answer a call you have to push the top part of the 'phone' button on the radio (trim 'Two') but the bottom part of the 'phone' button on the steering!


volkswagen routan
1 It would also be more convenient if there was a DC power outlet inside the armrest and if a power-adjustable seat was available.


volkswagen routan
2 The 'heated seat' is unnecessary and too expensive; you can buy heated cushion for less than $30.It is definitely a small car and may not suit you if you have a large family.

If you want a rocket, or a hauler the Prius C isn't for you, but if you want value economy and a small carbon foot print, Toyota Prius and Prius C is for you.

volkswagen routan
1 Like most cars, when the winter fuels are available then it goes down by 10-12%.

1 The V model rides higher then the standard Prius by almost an inch - does not sound like a lot but has made a big difference.


volkswagen routan
2 Also, the V has better ride quality then the standard Prius, I have owned both.

2 NOTHING wears off that new car feeling quicker than when there are problems with it.I looked at the Mazda CX5 and thought the car was excellent except the power was not real good for getting on to the freeway and I felt I was sitting kind of low or closed in inside.The CRV is a great car, but nothing really stood out for a wow factor, seeming kind of plain compared to the RAV4.I'm completely happy with my RAV4.


volkswagen routan
1 Very satisfied.The only things I would caution about are the options that really hike up the price quickly and aren't all that necessary; and secondly, the pressure at the dealer when you're forced to sit there, listening to an extended sales pitch for all the over priced stuff they want to sell, like an alarm, interior protection, paint protection, pre-paid warranty service and on and on.


volkswagen routan
2 Be wary of the delears out there and choose wisely.The final thing that pushed me over the edge to choose Toyota was the Service Department: how well they treat you for the service, offering free rides home or to work and being open all day on Saturday's.

1 The car has every option, many I still haven't touched.


volkswagen routan
1 I must say, the RAV4 drives great.


kia optima
1 It don't open sometimes and you have to be careful closing it making sure that both side latch.The CUE Infortainment System is cool but very unsafe, too much to think about while driving.


volkswagen routan
1 The engine has enough power to accelerate although it would never be considered fast.


volkswagen routan
1 I really liked the 2013 styling and never would have even considered the previous designs with the trunk spare tire thing.


volkswagen routan
1 I have averaged 25.4 MPG in my use which had been mainly Interstates in moderate mountains.


volkswagen routan
2 Since I do tend to speed, I'm happy.

2 Second update to KBB.Only issue was what product to corrosion proof the RAV4.Northeast Ohio roads use salt, brine & sand for winter safety.


volkswagen routan
1 Toyota would not give the writer the factory specs on corrosion proofing materials and systems applied to the vehicle.


kia optima
1 The touch input don't work for me.


volkswagen routan
1 Plan is to keep this RAV4 for at least 300k miles.Researched the corrosion proofing marketlace and hands down winner was Krown (Canadian based firm).

2 Time will tell on the effectivness and it will be way past these reviews.Ziebart was at the bottom of the list (past BAD experience).Bottom line: If you are in a harsh road or air environment, protect the vehicle from being a rust bucket.Note the pic: Changed out the LE's OEM steel rims & tires to black alloy spokes & 80k Cooper's on this Spruce Mica colored ride."

volkswagen routan
1 Local Ziebart yearly follow-ups are a joke .... just spray more black gunk on the undercarriage and done.


volkswagen routan
1 It has to rust thru for a fix to happen.... nothing preventative with sealing in the corrosion.

volkswagen routan
1 Not looking at their warranty but looking at their track record in real PREVENTION.


volkswagen routan
2 Found a local who oil sprays and has a track record of "show-me" prevention.Rustproofing is more than the body parts, its also addressing entire vehicles exposed mechanicals (brake & fuel lines, backing plates, fasteners, sensors, boxed in frame structures etc).Intend to keep KBB updatedFinal thought: Castrol Synthetic in the crankcase with 10k between changes.Final, final, thought: Toyotas are NOT "cheap-to-keep" any longer, but they REMAIN the "best-to-keep"."

volkswagen routan
2 I do love the updated exterior and the AWD is a must in New England and is superb in the snow.


volkswagen routan
2 I'm not a fan of the run flat tires especially because I'd have to replace them so often as they only get 25-30K miles on them and I found that if they do have any issues they go flat flat instantly, therefore there is no benefit in my opinion.


volkswagen routan
2 So I opted to use regular tires and keep a plug kit in my vehicle.


volkswagen routan
2 The car does drive very nice.

2 Traded for the Avalanche... and it is amazing.


volkswagen routan
1 The long slide feature in the 2011 leaves an attachment protruding about 2" above the floor when the seat is removed - not flat like the '07.


volkswagen routan
1 The right hand center row seat assembly is much wider to accommodate the middle "8th" passenger seat which attaches to the base of the seat assembly, thus making it much more difficult to remove.


volkswagen routan
2 I didn't want an 8 passenger vehicle, but had no choice with the V6.


volkswagen routan
1 The '07 had a fold down tray between the front seats which allowed long objects (such as 2X4s) to extend to the front dashboard and not hang out the rear.


volkswagen routan
2 The '11 has a non-removeable console between the front seats instead.


volkswagen routan
1 When the rear seats are up in place, the well behind them does not have a flat bottom.


volkswagen routan
2 The seat attachment arms rest along the bottom making it difficult to store things flat.I miss having the power rear vent windows that I had on the '07, and the instrumentation is a definite downgrade from the Optitron gauges on the '07.

2 After several months of dealing with this issue they found out that if you tilt the steering column then the steering wheel will NOT be straight.

volvo c30
2 The first two times, they told me they were able to duplicate the problem (on routes nowhere near my normal driving routes).


volvo c30
2 We arranged for a third visit when they could have a Toyota district service rep available to review the problem.


volvo c30
1 They kept the car for three days.


volvo c30
2 At they end of the three days they told me that they had replaced the radio with a radio from another, new Sienna on their lot.


volvo c30
1 It performed exactly as the original radio (with the echo).


volvo c30
1 Therefore, they said, the radio was functioning as designed and there was nothing they could do to solve the problem.


volvo c30
2 I got a call from a very polite man who told me that he had investigated the problem.


volvo c30
1 He gave me enough specifics (both specifics of the problem and the names of service personnel at the dealership) to satisfy me that he had indeed looked into it.


volvo c30
1 I guess when you only pay $40,000+ for a vehicle, a working radio is too much to expect.I also asked the dealership (on my first checkup) to look into what I believed was extremely excessive road noise.

1 They did look into it but before they even did so, they said it was most likely, you guessed it, functioning as designed.

volvo c30
1 The Sienna drove a whole lot better than the Touring Elite.


volvo c30
1 The bottom line to me was that the Sienna is a much better car than the Odyssey Touring Elite.


volvo c30
1 Even though I was willing to overlook the Odyssey's Hearst looking design, (What was I thinking) but then it definitely was a boon that the Honda dealer Manager was a moron.

1 I looked at all the full size SUVs and it came down to the Ford Expedition and the Sequoia.


volvo c30
1 I went with the Sequoia because of the following:1.


volvo c30
1 The second row seats slides for access to the third row.


volvo c30
2 This makes it easy for my kids to get in and out.2. Easier to drive and short turn radius.3.


volvo c30
1 I needed the power for towing our trail trailer.Mine also has the supercharger as well."

2 The mid gate is awesome for big loads, but find the 5ft bed to fill much of my weekend projects.


volvo c30
1 My wife and I both love driving this SUV.


volvo c30
1 More features & driver control than the Expy Limited we traded in.


volvo c30
1 The center console on the 2nd row is OFF THE HOOK! Love having 3 options to adjust the ride: smooth, normal, sport.


volvo c30
1 GREAT idea to put buttons behind and to the side of the 2nd row seats to lower or raise the 3rd row.


volvo c30
1 You can, as with the Expy, also do that from the back with the tailgate raised.


volvo c30
1 You CANNOT do that in a Chevy or Caddy.


volvo c30
1 Their 3rd row is still manual!


volvo c30
1 STUPID!


kia optima
2 The 3 panel bed cover is a great feature and keeps my stuff dry from rain.Interior has a lot of comfort, with dual power seats (I have the leather option), and the rear seats fits my 3 growing children with minimal fights.


volvo c30
1 They haven't changed that since they introduced the 3rd row!


volvo c30
2 We would have bought an Escalade if it weren't for the idiotic 3rd row.

1 But I digress.


volvo c30
2 Back to point: it has so far been everything we expected from Toyota.


volvo c30
1 Reliable, higher quality fit & trim, quieter ride than Expy.


volvo c30
1 The only glaring downsides are 1) DEFINITELY does not have the cargo room of an Expy.


volvo c30

1 And it hasn't.

2 Have dual climate control which helps keeps my wife happy.


volvo c30
1 Any significant variations among the different areas of the car would tell him the car had been repainted, indicating certainly body repair, and possibly an unknown/unreported wreck.


volvo c30
1 I had him test the Sequoia and the paint thickness was twice as much as the Expy.


volvo c30
1 This is an exceptional value vs the high end Lexus (same engine) and GM products.


volvo c30
1 I drove Suburbans for years until they became 80% plastic.


volvo c30
1 Because I keep my trucks for a long time and don't buy a new one every three years- I went for reliability.


volvo c30
2 If you want to experience why I turned away from GM, just sit in the back bucket seat of a Denali and then the back bucket of the Sequoia Platinum - absolutely no comparison.


volvo c30
1 The Denali interior is mostly plastic and the back buckets are perfectly sized for a dwarf.


volvo c30
2 I've now had my Sequoia Platinum almost 2 years and only two issues come to mind.


kia optima
2 Bluetooth option is awesome and with the mp3 port, I can get maximum use from my Smartphone.


volvo c30
2 First off, while the turning radius is incredible, the wheel is a little sloppy and steering seems engineered for female drivers more so than a work truck on a job site.

1 This is a great family car.


volvo c30
2 Its very spacious, reliable, agile, mechanically sound and sturdy vehicle.I have towed a large boat and driven on long road trips.


volvo c30
1 In both scenarios, this car performs flawlessly.The only complaints I have are:1) The paint seems like it scratches easily (specially the front of the car where every now and again a small rock will strike).


volvo c30
1 My suggestion would be: Avoid driving behind large trucks at all cost... Rock chips are common.2)


volvo c30
1 The gas mileage, of course.


volvo c30
1 Even with a clean air filter, new sparkplugs, highly inflated tires, this is a guzzler.


volvo c30
1 Even when driven at 55mph, this is a guzzler!

2 I bought the Husky Liners for all floor areas; never worried about spills, muddy feet or paws, sand, snow, etc. Oh, the turning radius is awesome!


volvo c30
2 I can easily turn into a parking space without having to back up first like my old Suburban.Yes, I am concerned with backing up since the car is so high.


volvo c30
1 My most major concern is those windshield columns or pillars.


volvo c30
1 Several times they have completely blocked out oncoming vehicles or people; in addition, the side mirrors have done the same thing.


volvo c30
2 My husband said he doesn't have that problem, so I adjusted the height of my seat - some help there.


volvo c30
1 One little annoyance: second row cup holders on the floor - wish they were on the arm rest or something.


volvo c30
2 It tends to get kicked and stepped on by my kids.Nevertheless, we love the car!


volvo c30
2 I knew it was a gas hog when I bought it, so I just drive carefully.


volvo c30

volvo c30
2 The only down fall for us would be that my extended family is always wanting to take it on trips.I would HIGHLY recommend the Sequoia." 5 people out of 5 found this review helpful


volvo c30
1 I have had my Sequoia for 2 years and the only reason I am keeping it is because of the towing.


volvo c30
2 The leather is cheap, the seats rattle and so much dust comes in through the hatch and doors you can taste it.


volvo c30
1 For an SUV, this is not an "off-road" vehicle.


volvo c30
2 I live back 8 miles on a dirt road and by the time I get to pavement, I choke on the dust coming in.

1 However, I do not haul dirt, mud run, mountain climb, drag race or stunt jump with this truck.


volvo c30
1 I'm a huge Ford/Chevy fan but after test driving the 2008 Sequoia Limited, it was hands down a clear winner.


volvo c30
1 It's built solid, very powerful (5.7L,


volvo c30
1 V8), and handles like a vehicle half its size.


volvo c30
2 The turning radius on this is ridiculous .... better than my Explorer, and definitely better than my Cadillac.


volvo c30
1 I also recommend the 2.5" flip down rear view camera if you don't get the navigation package (the nav includes the back-up camera which is a MUCH bigger screen but tacks on another $4k as a package.)


volvo c30
1 If you don't carry a CDL license, trust me, you'll need the bumper sensors and cameras because this is a sizable truck and it has quite a few blind spots.


volvo c30
2 The style is a big improvement over the previous models, specifically the front.


volvo c30
2 I've been told that other than the front, the truck looks plain, but I think it's a nice change compared to other SUVs that slap on useless plastic molding and trim.


volvo c30
1 My only knock on Toyota is that they obviously don't understand American consumers; we like the flexibility to purchase individual options vs. the manufacturer's option packages.


volvo c30
1 Their option packages are impractical and don't make a lot of sense to me.


volvo c30
1 I'm still trying to figure out how I got the optional illuminated ash/coin tray.


volvo c30
2 It's been mentioned in a few industry magazines that Toyota recognizes this issue with their relatively new venture into the truck market as compared to seasoned manufacturers like Ford and GM, so they may be changing their program in the near future.


volvo c30
1 Just keep this in mind when you're shopping around.

volvo c30

volvo c30
1 What I love: It's an incredibly powerful vehicle for towing our small boat, It pulls it like a little toy, Interior is very comfortable, spacious and has so much storage, brakes are very good, turning radius is good, gas mileage isn't too bad for such a large and power vehicle, dependability is excellent.

1 Towing power is great, can handle the big jobs without barely breaking a sweat.

1 Comfort is good all around, turning radius is exceptional for a large SUV, very helpful in tight parking situations.

1 I rent and lease a dozen cars a year.


kia optima
2 The truck is an amazing vehicle allowing me to utilize a 8.2ft bed when necessary which comes in handy for smaller moves and the option to leave the locking bed covered always comes in handy.


volvo xc70
1 This is the only full size SUV for a demanding car nut, business man and father as myself!


volvo xc70
2 I spend weeks researching and driving cars each year for company trasportation.Gas Miles avg. is a consistant 17.8 city - 19.4 on the road.My wife wishes the SR5 model came with the remote truck release option and backup camera - which by the way only comes on the more exspensive LIMITED and Platium versions at a tune of more than $5,000!!!!!!!!!!!!My wife, the President of the company has taken ownership of the 2008.


volvo xc70
2 And, in the 1st quarter of 2010, I'll going to get another Sequoia for myself.


volvo xc70
1 I have owned 2 Tahoes and really liked them.


volvo xc70
1 They don't even compare to the Sequoia.


volvo xc70
2 By far the best SUV I've owned.


volvo xc70
2 Pulls my RV twice as good as my '07 Tahoe did.


volvo xc70
2 Smooth, comfortable ride.


volvo xc70
1 The amenities the Sequoia has campared to the Tahoe is unbelievable.


kia optima
1 I threw some offroad wheels and tires on there and now there is no terrain I cant cover...Not to mention is rides as smooth as a Cadillac on the streets.


volvo xc70
1 The 3rd row seats on the Tahoe had to be removed and they weigh a ton.


volvo xc70
1 Love the Sequoia's fold down 3rd row.

volvo xc70
2 I bought my Sequoia back in March of 08.


volvo xc70
2 I always wanted a Sequoia, but after they changed the style on the 08 I knew I had to have it.


volvo xc70
2 I have the SR5 w/ the 4.7engine.


volvo xc70
1 I know the mpg advertised w/the truck is not the best out there, however, with the gas prices going down it does not seem that much of a difference from v6 car.


volvo xc70
1 Plus, this car takes regular gas, so you don't have to put top of the line gasoline.


volvo xc70
2 I have the 2nd row w/o the captain chairs and I wish I would of asked for it, but I guess w/ 3 toddlers in the truck it was a good decision.


volvo xc70
2 The room on this truck is wonderful.


volvo xc70
2 I can fit all my 3 kids w/ car seats in the 2nd row w/o a problem.


volvo xc70
1 I drove the truck in a long road trip and this truck performed like a well oiled machine.


volvo xc70
1 I love the back window that has the ability to go up and down if I wish just by a press of a button.


volvo xc70
1 I wish I had picked the 5.7 engine which gives out 381 HP, but 276 HP that I have now is enough.


volvo xc70
1 The steering wheel is real smooth when turning of backing up trying to park, plus this truck never hesitates when accelerating unlike other trucks produced by GMC.


volvo xc70
1 OH, I previously owned a Mitsubishi Montero before this truck and even though the Montero didn't give me any problems, this truck is far superior than the Montero and the other trucks Yukon, Armada, and Tahoe, that I test drove.


volvo xc70
2 OH OH, and this truck is like a tank going through snow, I was fortunate to drive through a foot or more of snow w/o any signs of getting stuck, I have to say it was very joyful driving through the snow like water while other cars were stuck!" 1 person out of 1 found this review helpful


volvo xc70
2 Have owned for about 2 years and overall enjoy the vehicle.


kia optima
2 A great work truck, and a great ride.


volvo xc70
2 We purchased it because of its interior room since we travel extensively for basketball tournaments and back and forth to college in Tennessee.


volvo xc70
2 The quality of this vehicle is not up to what Toyota is supposed to be about.


volvo xc70
1 The transmission is not very smooth, especially at lower speeds, it seaches constantly for the right gear.


volvo xc70
1 Gas pedal is very 'jerky".


volvo xc70
1 Needs sensors in the center of the front bumper not just on the ends due to visibility issues.


volvo xc70
1 Performance, towing and pickup are great,lots of power.


volvo xc70
1 Comfort inside is excellant however even though this is the Platinum edition, materials are a bit "cheap".


volvo xc70
1 The nav system is annoying in that you cannot operate it when the vehicle is moving.


volvo xc70
1 I agree with this if you are by yourself, but if you have a passenger with you in the right front seat, they should be able to use system without having to stop.Overall, a very nice road vehicle with tons of storage room.


volvo xc70
2 Toyota needs to get back to quality, like before, and not like when they first were built in the 60's.


volvo xc70
1 Engines and trans were great, but bodies were terrible.

2 With the Sequoia, I can't tell anything is back there.


volvo xc70
1 And all the mirrors make it a breeze to back a 9 ft wide pontoon into an 11 ft wide carport.


volvo xc70
2 The truck does fine in Chicago traffic, and I have no problems with on-street parking - all the sonar and the rear view camera do help with that - or issues with garage heights.


volvo xc70
1 The adaptive cruise control takes a little getting used to, but is really nice on open roads.


kia optima
2 Drives and rides like a car, but if you need, it can be a truck.


volvo xc70
1 One issue, the cruise control in adaptive mode doesn't like rain, but you can turn the radar off and use regular cruise control mode.


volvo xc70
2 I usually use the "sport" ride set-up, and it's still comfortable and almost as quick as the BMW.


volvo xc70
1 It doesn't blow as much as the BMW in crosswinds, and is really stable on ice.


volvo xc70
1 I like that I decide when she's in 2, 4, or 4 Low wheel drive, v. some computer.


volvo xc70
1 In soft mode it rides like a luxury sedan.


volvo xc70
2 I have had no service issues, and haven't paid a cent for maintenance service through 3 oil changes.


volvo xc70

2 Bigger than the Tahoe, 381 HP V8, buy one certified used from Toyota, get the SR5 with all the options (cheaper than a Limited with few options).


volvo xc70
2 14 MPG all the time, 13 in 4x4 (real figures from my dash after 1 year).


volvo xc70
1 If you buy, check the door code for the one with 10Klbs, not all 2008's are true 10Klbs towing capacity, even if there is a towing package.


volvo xc70
2 Check the engine code on the door jam and bump it against the 2008 Sequoia owners manual.


volvo xc70
1 There are 6 different towing capacities for the 2008 and 2009.


volvo xc70
1 For 2010, it's all 10Klbs if you opt for the 5.7Litre V8.


volvo xc70
2 Kids love it, huge 3rd row is why we bought it.


kia optima
2 On a day to day basis, I use the car for getting back and forth to work and my kids back and forth to school.


volvo xc70
1 With seats down, it can hold end to end a military army cot and you can sleep on it.


volvo xc70
1 Could be used as an ambulance for that matter.


volvo xc70
1 4x4 is good, locking differential is very nice.


volvo xc70
1 SR5 has all the manual goodies that won't break down and are easy to maintain.


volvo xc70
2 Limited and Platinum have ride height suspensions that can get into the thousands to replace.


volvo xc70
1 Toyotas are safe, Congress is trying to slam Toyota to get their money back through GM and Chrysler increased sales as a result of an organized Toyota smear campaign.

volvo xc70
1 Air vents for all three rows leaves my babies warm in the winter and cool in the summer.


volvo xc70

1 The cargo space behind the 3rd row holds my duo stroller and leaves plenty of room.

2 The running boards make it so easy for them to climb in!


volvo xc70
2 The storage in the armrest between the driver and the passenger is so huge!


volvo xc70

volvo xc90
1 The Sequoia scares me given its high center of gravity, ultra short steering radius with no resistance, High Torque and a 4WD system that makes you switch it on/off at low speeds, so when you are on the highway in variable conditions you better have it on or it will be too late to help you maintain control.


volvo xc90
1 In my first snow storm I was feeling the truck sway and cars where spinning out ahead and could not engage the 4WD!!!


volvo xc90
2 So you need to leave it on and watch the fuel gauge move fast at 11.5 mpg.It also has several overpriced and useless options/ features like the Radar Controlled Cruise which is frequently unavailable when the truck is dirty or wet and the manual leveling system, it's a lot quicker and easier to adust a trailer height than this truck's height!I was sold on the interior and seat comfort which is nicer than the GM and Ford Big SUVs but is hard to be comfortable when it doesn't provide a modern 4WD and safe handling.I care about my friends too much recommend this joke of a 4WD SUV to them.

2 I own a 2008 sequoia, and have issues with the cd changer skipping while driving.

kia optima
2 I owned a '03 and now recently purchased a '13 Black Diamond.


volvo xc90
1 I emailed Toyota and their answer was that I don't have any options, and they will not do anything to help.


volvo xc90
2 I also own a Nissan, and when I had a similar issue with a problem the dealership couldn't find, they called the dealership and assured me that they would keep on the problem until it was resolved.


volvo xc90
1 There is obviously a big problem with Toyota customer retention, and consumers should beware before buying from a company that has such an obvious disregard for customer loyalty.

volvo xc90
2 We love this truck and expected to have it for another 7 years but the main support frame has rusted out from the inside of the box spring areas, places where the owner cannot apply rust preventatives.Toyota has had an ongoing issue with Tacoma frames since the mid-90s but still keeps using the same flawed design.


kia optima
1 I flew to Albuquerque, NM for a job interview with an aviation firm in 2008.


volvo xc90
2 Their frame rust proofing consists of only a layer of paint, to the exterior of the frame, that wears off and then you have to apply oil to the frame to prevent rusting.


volvo xc90
2 However you cannot apply oil to the interior of the box frame areas and this is where my frame has rusted through.At this point I have a truck that looks and runs great that can neither be traded in or ethically sold to someone other than the junk yard.


volvo xc90
1 Of course it should be noted that Toyota warrants the body against rusting for 5 years but only warrants the frame for 3 years.


volvo xc90
2 Toyota's response is only that it's not under warranty or recall so it's not their problem."

volvo xc90
1 The interior is a bit dated by today's standards and it doesn't have all the nice options that many vehicles do, but if that is what you are looking for, you probably don't have need for a truck that can perform as a TRUCK.

volvo xc90
1 The 2005 model was a much needed and highly welcomed upgrade from the lingering smaller tacoma that it replaced.


volvo xc90
2 The larger interior size, which was its previous downfall as it was very cramp and confining has been transformed into a roomy spacious cabin!!controls are easy to reach and layout is about where you expect things to be.The 4.0L V6 has great power available and returns respectable MPG (I get about 18MPG overall with an automatic - I'd have to cruise about 65MPH on the freeway to break 20MPG)responcive handling and expected somewhat stiff ride for the TRD off-road pkg.Inside agian, they went gangbusters for storage.

2 behind AND under the back seats there is enourmous storage for tiedowns, tools, chains, blankets, food and what ever you may need for emergencies - really, there is toms of storage!!Now then, here's what i didn't like about the new Taco: the cloth seats are terrbile at stains - if you even spill WATER on the cloth seats, it will leave a water mark!! get them wet at all and you have a water mark!! the radio is very difficult to see in the daytime, and impossible to see when wearing sunglasses!!

1 Despite all of the problems Toyota has had, the Tacoma is an awesome vehicle.


volvo xc90
2 My truck is the basic 2 door, 2WD, 4 speed automatic, and through all the hills in Kansas and Missouri, it pulled itself right up, never downshifting.

2 The seats in the base model do leave something to be desired with the fact that the backrest can't be adjusted, all they do is move forward and back, but are still comfortable.

1 I went with the PreRunner Double Cab, 4.0, Auto, 2wd, short bed, SR5 with some other options as well.


volvo xc90
1 There is alot of competition in this class, I also considered the Frontier, Raider, Dakota, and Canyon.


volvo xc90
2 I liked the looks of the Taco best, but had other things to consider.


volvo xc90
2 I have two children in car seats, I have to tow from time to time, and I travel from time to time, upwards of 2k miles per trip.


volvo xc90
1 The Dakota interior feels too cheap and not really comfy.


volvo xc90
1 The Raider is still a 'new' model in the class but they launched with one helluva vehicle!

volvo xc90
1 3 bucks / gal for gas, no thanks to 13-19mpg.

2 The Canyon was nice, but the dealer wouldn't deal with my trade.

volvo xc90
1 Overall, it is a great vehicle....oil and air filter changes pretty much sum up the routine maintenance.


volvo xc90
2 However, the brakes have had to be changed twice, and the original plugs were fouled, and when checked I was told by the mechanic that the plugs were not the usual Toyota plugs, but a cheaper brand.


volvo xc90
1 Also, the use of a LOT more plastic, particularly outside the vehicle, is disappointing on a truck like this....scratches easily, and expensive to replace.

volvo s80
1 When the truck was brand new back in 2009, there was a problem whenever the automatic transmission was put into park.


volvo s80
2 Sometimes it would lock properly and the vehicle would "think" it was still in drive or reverse and roll forward or backward.


volvo s80
1 This was also fixed by the dealer under warranty and there has not been a problem since.


volvo s80
2 In my opinion, it is not the little things like this that make a vehicle good or bad.


volvo s80
2 The truck is extremely reliable and has not had any problems with the drivetrain (engine, transmission, etc), and it is also an extremely durable little truck.


volvo s80
2 Despite being a 2-wheel drive, my truck does okay in mud and other messy conditions.


volvo s80
2 I would NOT take it off-roading, but the traction control combined with superior engineering make it adequate in mud, water, and snow.The air-conditioner in my Tacoma is very powerful and blows FREEZING COLD.


volvo s80
2 It performed flawlessly during all the summer 2011 heat waves we had.


volvo s80
1 The heater will roast you out of the cab and if you hold your hand close to the vent when it is on full blast you will just about burn your hand!For a base model truck, my Tacoma has an adequate stereo system.


volvo s80
2 It has an AM/FM CD/MP3 player with 4 speakers and a handy auxiliary plug-in for my iPod.


kia optima
2 So I bought another one.


volvo s80
2 The speakers are not very good and I sometimes have to turn the volume on full blast to hear the song.


volvo s80
2 I plan on upgrading the speakers in the future with more powerful aftermarket units.


volvo s80
1 It just has 2-speed wipers with a "mist" function (basically just flicking the control stick manually every few seconds during a drizzle), and a windshield washer.


volvo s80
2 You do not realize how much you take intermittent wipers for granted until you've driven in a light rain without them!


volvo s80
2 Even worse is that I did not even realize my truck didn't have this feature until TWO DAYS after we bought it!


volvo s80
1 Apparently you have to get the "preferred convenience package" or something like that, which includes several other options like cruise control and drives the price up considerably.


volvo s80
1 Even for the 2012 model year, the regular cab Tacoma is not available with intermittent wipers.


volvo s80
1 According to a Toyota salesman I talked to, intermittent wipers are option on the 4-wheel drive regular cab, but not available on any 2-wheel drive regular cab.

1 Hauls 5 people in the lap of luxury w/a bed full of gear while hauling a boat all at the same time!


volvo s80

volvo s80
2 I've started to get used to it (though I still plan on putting in intermittent wipers sometime in the future), but I just wanted to educate those who want to buy a new or used Tacoma about this fact before they decided to make a purchase.Except for the lack of intermittent wipers, I love the Toyota Tacoma and would absolutely recommend it to nayone looking for a compact pickup truck!" 1 person out of 1 found this review helpful

2 I have owned 5 trucks in my lifetime, including Isuzu, Nissan x2, Chevy, Ford and Dodge; but never a Toyota..... until now.By far, this is the best truck I have ever owned.


volvo s80
1 Comfort is exceptional for a truck, as well as ride and performance.


volvo s80
1 Not only does it handle like a car, but gets nearly the same MPG, dialing in at an average of 19.5-20.5, even with my heavy boot.


volvo s80
2 If you want the seats to feel like a car, DO NOT get the TRD model, as these are sport seats, designed for a FUN ride.


volvo s80
1 The standard seats are heavier in the fabric, as well as fully stuffed cushioning, for maximum comfort.


volvo s80
2 But let's face it, if I wanted the sit and ride of a luxury car, I wouldn't have bought a truck.The legroom of the Tacoma is surprisingly expansive, as I am a 6ft adult male, and have - on more than one occasion - had 3 other adults riding with me; all of which would comment on the shock of the leg room and comfort of a 4 door midsized truck.Beyond the interior design - which is ergonomic and designed for the driver - the exterior is just as meticulously designed, with the owner in mind.


volvo s80
1 From symmetry of the lines on the body, to the one piece bed and and "tracks" which line the bed, for ease of strapping.


volvo s80
2 Compartments galore, mean you'll never want for storage, and the accessories made for the truck, mean you can always find something new to add on.I am a new believer and lover of the Tacoma, dunked in the waters of Toyota; and will never own anything else." 1 person out of 1 found this review helpful

2 I have had it since it was new in 05, and havent had a single problem out of it and wouldnt trade it for anything else.

2 works like a full size with the mpg of a 6cyl!! i've owned a Tundra and 4 runner and by far i like the new tacomas best!


hyundai accent
1 dont get me wrong, my Tundra was great! but 11mpgs vs 18 (and they are/was both on 32s) and the tacoma will pull just like the tundra and has as much room.

2 We love this truck and expected to have it for another 7 years but the main support frame has rusted out from the inside of the box spring areas, places where the owner cannot apply rust preventatives.Toyota has had an ongoing issue with Tacoma frames since the mid-90s but still keeps using the same flawed design.


volvo xc90
2 Their frame rust proofing consists of only a layer of paint, to the exterior of the frame, that wears off and then you have to apply oil to the frame to prevent rusting.


volvo xc90
2 However you cannot apply oil to the interior of the box frame areas and this is where my frame has rusted through.At this point I have a truck that looks and runs great that can neither be traded in or ethically sold to someone other than the junk yard.


volvo xc90
1 Of course it should be noted that Toyota warrants the body against rusting for 5 years but only warrants the frame for 3 years.


volvo xc90
2 Toyota's response is only that it's not under warranty or recall so it's not their problem."

1 So much so you'll have to watch your speed as it's easy climb above the speed limit and not know with this power and ride.As with the demand for Toyota Tacoma's they are loaded with almost every options produced.


volvo xc90
1 That is the mixed blessings with the 4x4 Tacoma's you have to accept.


volvo xc90
1 But again you're going to retain the worth in used book value.


volvo xc90
1 Tacoma's are good for a hundred thousand miles with minimal care other than the basic care any vehicle will require.

volvo xc90
1 The interior is a bit dated by today's standards and it doesn't have all the nice options that many vehicles do, but if that is what you are looking for, you probably don't have need for a truck that can perform as a TRUCK.

volvo xc90
1 The 2005 model was a much needed and highly welcomed upgrade from the lingering smaller tacoma that it replaced.


volvo xc90
2 The larger interior size, which was its previous downfall as it was very cramp and confining has been transformed into a roomy spacious cabin!!controls are easy to reach and layout is about where you expect things to be.The 4.0L V6 has great power available and returns respectable MPG (I get about 18MPG overall with an automatic - I'd have to cruise about 65MPH on the freeway to break 20MPG)responcive handling and expected somewhat stiff ride for the TRD off-road pkg.Inside agian, they went gangbusters for storage.

2 behind AND under the back seats there is enourmous storage for tiedowns, tools, chains, blankets, food and what ever you may need for emergencies - really, there is toms of storage!!Now then, here's what i didn't like about the new Taco: the cloth seats are terrbile at stains - if you even spill WATER on the cloth seats, it will leave a water mark!! get them wet at all and you have a water mark!! the radio is very difficult to see in the daytime, and impossible to see when wearing sunglasses!!

volvo xc90
2 My 2002 was completely reliable with 80K miles on it, but I wanted a 4 wheel drive, so I treated myself to a new Tacoma in 2007.


volvo xc90
1 Overall, it is a great vehicle....oil and air filter changes pretty much sum up the routine maintenance.


volvo xc90
2 However, the brakes have had to be changed twice, and the original plugs were fouled, and when checked I was told by the mechanic that the plugs were not the usual Toyota plugs, but a cheaper brand.


volvo xc90
1 Also, the use of a LOT more plastic, particularly outside the vehicle, is disappointing on a truck like this....scratches easily, and expensive to replace.


volvo xc90
1 Interior wise, the drivers side is smaller than the passenger side by inches (I do not understand this), the rear view mirror is too low, and the cup holders make no sense.

2 In my opinion, it is not the little things like this that make a vehicle good or bad.

2 Despite being a 2-wheel drive, my truck does okay in mud and other messy conditions.

volvo s80
2 It performed flawlessly during all the summer 2011 heat waves we had.


volvo s80
1 The heater will roast you out of the cab and if you hold your hand close to the vent when it is on full blast you will just about burn your hand!For a base model truck, my Tacoma has an adequate stereo system.


volvo s80
2 It has an AM/FM CD/MP3 player with 4 speakers and a handy auxiliary plug-in for my iPod.


volvo s80
2 The speakers are not very good and I sometimes have to turn the volume on full blast to hear the song.


volvo s80
2 I plan on upgrading the speakers in the future with more powerful aftermarket units.


volvo s80
1 It just has 2-speed wipers with a "mist" function (basically just flicking the control stick manually every few seconds during a drizzle), and a windshield washer.


volvo s80
2 You do not realize how much you take intermittent wipers for granted until you've driven in a light rain without them!


kia optima
2 We have three kids and find it very friendly.


volvo s80
2 Even worse is that I did not even realize my truck didn't have this feature until TWO DAYS after we bought it!


volvo s80
1 Apparently you have to get the "preferred convenience package" or something like that, which includes several other options like cruise control and drives the price up considerably.


volvo s80
1 Even for the 2012 model year, the regular cab Tacoma is not available with intermittent wipers.


volvo s80
1 According to a Toyota salesman I talked to, intermittent wipers are option on the 4-wheel drive regular cab, but not available on any 2-wheel drive regular cab.


volvo s80
1 Anyway, this is all a matter of preference.


volvo s80
2 To some people it does not matter if their car has intermittent wipers, and to some it does.


volvo s80
2 I've started to get used to it (though I still plan on putting in intermittent wipers sometime in the future), but I just wanted to educate those who want to buy a new or used Tacoma about this fact before they decided to make a purchase.Except for the lack of intermittent wipers, I love the Toyota Tacoma and would absolutely recommend it to nayone looking for a compact pickup truck!" 1 person out of 1 found this review helpful

1 The standard seats are heavier in the fabric, as well as fully stuffed cushioning, for maximum comfort.


volvo s80
2 But let's face it, if I wanted the sit and ride of a luxury car, I wouldn't have bought a truck.The legroom of the Tacoma is surprisingly expansive, as I am a 6ft adult male, and have - on more than one occasion - had 3 other adults riding with me; all of which would comment on the shock of the leg room and comfort of a 4 door midsized truck.Beyond the interior design - which is ergonomic and designed for the driver - the exterior is just as meticulously designed, with the owner in mind.

2 We love this truck and expected to have it for another 7 years but the main support frame has rusted out from the inside of the box spring areas, places where the owner cannot apply rust preventatives.Toyota has had an ongoing issue with Tacoma frames since the mid-90s but still keeps using the same flawed design.


hyundai veracruz
1 But it is accurate and smart.


bmw 5-series
2 I love this truck.


volvo xc90
2 Their frame rust proofing consists of only a layer of paint, to the exterior of the frame, that wears off and then you have to apply oil to the frame to prevent rusting.


volvo xc90
2 However you cannot apply oil to the interior of the box frame areas and this is where my frame has rusted through.At this point I have a truck that looks and runs great that can neither be traded in or ethically sold to someone other than the junk yard.

1 Of course it should be noted that Toyota warrants the body against rusting for 5 years but only warrants the frame for 3 years.

2 The larger interior size, which was its previous downfall as it was very cramp and confining has been transformed into a roomy spacious cabin!!controls are easy to reach and layout is about where you expect things to be.The 4.0L V6 has great power available and returns respectable MPG (I get about 18MPG overall with an automatic - I'd have to cruise about 65MPH on the freeway to break 20MPG)responcive handling and expected somewhat stiff ride for the TRD off-road pkg.Inside agian, they went gangbusters for storage.

1 Overall, it is a great vehicle....oil and air filter changes pretty much sum up the routine maintenance.

2 However, the brakes have had to be changed twice, and the original plugs were fouled, and when checked I was told by the mechanic that the plugs were not the usual Toyota plugs, but a cheaper brand.

1 When the truck was brand new back in 2009, there was a problem whenever the automatic transmission was put into park.


volvo s80
2 Sometimes it would lock properly and the vehicle would "think" it was still in drive or reverse and roll forward or backward.


volvo s80
1 This was also fixed by the dealer under warranty and there has not been a problem since.


volvo s80
2 In my opinion, it is not the little things like this that make a vehicle good or bad.


volvo s80
2 The truck is extremely reliable and has not had any problems with the drivetrain (engine, transmission, etc), and it is also an extremely durable little truck.


volvo s80
2 Despite being a 2-wheel drive, my truck does okay in mud and other messy conditions.


volvo s80
2 I would NOT take it off-roading, but the traction control combined with superior engineering make it adequate in mud, water, and snow.The air-conditioner in my Tacoma is very powerful and blows FREEZING COLD.

2 It performed flawlessly during all the summer 2011 heat waves we had.

1 The heater will roast you out of the cab and if you hold your hand close to the vent when it is on full blast you will just about burn your hand!For a base model truck, my Tacoma has an adequate stereo system.

2 I plan on upgrading the speakers in the future with more powerful aftermarket units.


volvo s80
1 It just has 2-speed wipers with a "mist" function (basically just flicking the control stick manually every few seconds during a drizzle), and a windshield washer.


volvo s80
2 You do not realize how much you take intermittent wipers for granted until you've driven in a light rain without them!


volvo s80
2 Even worse is that I did not even realize my truck didn't have this feature until TWO DAYS after we bought it!


volvo s80
1 Apparently you have to get the "preferred convenience package" or something like that, which includes several other options like cruise control and drives the price up considerably.


volvo s80
1 Even for the 2012 model year, the regular cab Tacoma is not available with intermittent wipers.


volvo s80

1 TRUCK OR AVALANCHE TOOK THEM BOTH OUT.

volvo s80
2 If you want the seats to feel like a car, DO NOT get the TRD model, as these are sport seats, designed for a FUN ride.


volvo s80
1 The standard seats are heavier in the fabric, as well as fully stuffed cushioning, for maximum comfort.


volvo s80
2 But let's face it, if I wanted the sit and ride of a luxury car, I wouldn't have bought a truck.The legroom of the Tacoma is surprisingly expansive, as I am a 6ft adult male, and have - on more than one occasion - had 3 other adults riding with me; all of which would comment on the shock of the leg room and comfort of a 4 door midsized truck.Beyond the interior design - which is ergonomic and designed for the driver - the exterior is just as meticulously designed, with the owner in mind.

2 The first generation Tundra was too small a truck for what I needed, but it was great for what it was.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 The Chevy did have more room and power, but I was shocked at what an unreliable monster it was.

2 2007 Z-71 Chevy Avalanche... Beautiful truck...


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 It really made me sad about giving up my Toyota.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 After numerous issues with the Chevy, and seeing the 2007 Tundra come out, I decided to get back into a Tundra.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 It's easily the best truck I've ever owned.

1 For a relatively new entry into the full size truck game, the Toyota has definitely raised the bar for the old guard.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 This Truck is wicked fast to me and my other car(s) are a Challenger R/T Hemi and a Hemi Grand Cherokee.


kia optima
1 I loved it...


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 The Tundra rides and drives like a big Lexus even with the TRD Off Road Tires and suspension.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 I agree with the other reviewers that the visibility could be better and the back-up camera should be standard.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 Mine does not have it and backing up is a anxiety producing endeavor.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 Of the three vehicles, the Tundra is always my first choice even though it is a thirsty beast.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 The Jeep avgs 10-12 mpg city/14-16 Hwy to the Tundra's 13-14 city/17-18 Hwy.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 Not to mention the amazingly quick Toyota service compared to the tortise slow Chrysler service.


kia optima
2 I am currently without it due to transmission failure for the second time since I bought it NEW.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 Or, to be less critical of the competition, I will say that Toyota gets a lot more right than they get wrong.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 On the highway and even on secondary roads the Tundra seems to shrink in size to a midsize vehicle.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 The steering is very precise and the handling is excellent when you consider the almost 3 tons of real estate you are hurling across the asphalt on 4 little rubber donuts.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 The spacious and airy cabin along with the lack of wind and road noise and the smooth solid ride and good road manners makes long distance travel in the Tundra almost painless.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 Navigating small city streets in heavy traffic, or parking in small tight parkings spaces, not so much.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 In this area, I think all full size pickups become less of a joy and more of a pain to drive so that is not a flaw of the Tundra but a flaw of all big vehicles in general.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 However, I don't think all full size trucks share the Tundra's car like driving and handling attributes.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 Some trucks drive and handle like a truck.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 Which to me means clumsy, imprecise handling, and unpleastant surprises when vehicle is asked to change direction quickly or change direction while braking or God forbid, braking, changing direction, and hitting a bump or two in the road all at the same time."

hyundai genesis-coupe
1 The glove box, front dash storage and center console are very large.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 I've been rear-ended twice in our Tundra.


hyundai genesis-coupe

1 Engine reliable (so far).Transmission... I've read a LOT of reviews now about how terrible the transmission is and I'm experiencing first hand... even the rental car people told me that they've been renting under warranty to a LOT of chevy owners.Usefulness of the truck is great... Midgate is awesome.Add in mud guards as soon as you buy or else even small rocks will chip the paint.. great investment.LASTLY, DO NOT THINK YOU ARE GOING TO GET A LOT OF SERVICE FROM GM... DEALERSHIPS ARE HELPFUL MOST OF THE TIME, BUT GM COULDN'T GIVE A RIP. Also, if you are gonna by... don't get the Xilon coating and buy the extended warranty...

2 The Good: Tons of power, pretty smooth engine and trans, pulls and stops a trailer with no problem, steering is kind of soft but it's very responsive and stable at high speeds, interior is comfortable and has plenty of storage for anything you can think of, excellent reliability, lots of truck for what you pay for.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 The Bad: Cheap, squeaky plastics on the interior, visibility out back could be better, bouncy and jittery ride, paint chips too easily.


hyundai genesis-coupe

1 I'm a tall guy and I love the comfort.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 I sold the 5th wheel but for 2 years towed it everywhere.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 I had a Reese 15k 5th wheel hitch and with an offset on the trailer hitch I never once came close to jack-knifing the trailer with a 6.5 ft bed.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 The truck drives almost like a sports car in a trucks body if you get the 5.7L 6 speed transmission.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 But make sure you get the SR5 or offroad package because it has the 4.3 rear differential.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 If you get the 4.1 rear diff you're wasting the 6 speed.


hyundai genesis-coupe

hyundai genesis-coupe
1 The windshield when driving into direct sunlight does seem to have some built in specs.The body panels are a bit on the thin side.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 The towing mirrors are great but need to be folded in when you're in a parking lot as they stick out too far and people walk into them.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 If you're not going to tow a lot, I highly recommend the standard mirrors or the automatic retracting type.

1 Got the big v-8 and 8 ft bed.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 I don't know why, but I actually thought that this was a heavy duty truck comparable with a 3/4 ton.


hyundai genesis-coupe

kia optima
1 Love being able to have bed locked up.

hyundai genesis-coupe

2 The Tundra Exceeds all my expectations there are only minor things I miss from my Avalanche like auto wipers, when you locked the doors it locked the tailgate also, the auto start would turn the heat or a/c on and the tire pressure monitors told you how much pressure was in each tire.

hyundai genesis-coupe
1 Ford looked great with their new engine lineup (plenty of power and good mpgs), but there were no rebates or incentives when I was looking which resulted in about a $35k vehicle for what I wanted.

hyundai genesis-coupe
1 This is with oversize (20") custom wheels & tires.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 Absolutely one of best vehicles I have driven over the years even taking into account all the ribbing one takes about the "Toyota recalls".


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 All over blown media hype in my opinion.

2 I purchased the 4WD truck new and I have owned the vehicle for 3 years.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 The truck was used to haul rocks (landscape) logs, sand & cement.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 I have not towed anything with it.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 On weekends it serves as my fishing truck (spring, summer and fall); in winter I use it to go to my weekend getaways in Truckee and Lake Tahoe.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 It is my 2nd Tundra and has never failed me.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 It performs admirably in snow (BF Goodrich Rugged Terrain tires) and easily fords streams and negotiates steep river banks (East Fork of the Carson River, HWY 4).

2 It has very good handling and power.

2 I have owned 4 Fords, and one Dodge Pickup.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 When a friend suggested I test drove a Tundra, I was reluctant, but it was love upon first test drive.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 This thing rides like a car, and works like a truck.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 I was more supprised to find out that it is assembled in the USA, unlike my Canadian made Fords, and Mexican made Dodge.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 This half ton does all I need, to run my contracting business.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 I have full length side tool boxes and racks, awsome power, and as much towing and hauling capacity as I need.

hyundai genesis-coupe
2 Have owned my 07 5.7 v-8 CrewMax since Nov 07.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 I have owned all other trucks and I still have a dodge that is in great shape, but I needed something with more power and room.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 The biggest problem is the gas mileage.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 I average 17mpg and only 12 while towing.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 The truck has plenty of room front and back with lots of bells and whisels.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 However, I only recomend the 5.7 since it has proven better reliability, and the gas mileage is about the same with other engines.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 If you get the crewmax the bed will be too small for 4x8 sheets or stander lumber.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 However, if you are looking for a daily truck with a bit more gas milage and nice looks the GMC Sierra is nice with a comfortable ride.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 However, if you are looking for a nice looking truck with power (but without the diesel) and plenty of room and resale the toyota can not be beat.


kia optima
2 I drive up and down the West coast, Seattle to L.A. and have had no problems what ever, really enjoy the cruse control.

hyundai genesis-coupe
1 The pleasant surprise was the truck has a ton of power, but there are a LOT of little things/aesthetically pleasing additions to this truck.

hyundai genesis-coupe
2 Durring the test drive I gave it hll, and after just comeing from the lots of the big 3, there was no question of the funest truck to drive.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 These reviews that are clameing that their Tundras sound like diesels must have lower than 87 octane gas or some serious issues.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 I have the 5.7L.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 When it is below 0, on start up there is some noise for a few seconds.

hyundai genesis-coupe
2 As someone that's owned just about every truck, I first didn't care much for the Tundra, but now I've change my mind.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 I decided to buy a Tundra after seeing how great and reliable our company two '07 and one '08 Tundra work trucks have been.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 All three have over 115k miles...


kia rio
2 The cargo room is great and I love the security of a locking truck bed without having to spend the additional cost for a cover.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 The thing with the Tundra is that it's a great truck but with a few obvious flaws.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 EPA estimates make buyers believe that other trucks will save them money overtime.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 The 5.7 and 4.7 (don't know much about the 4.6) engines are, in my opinion, the best out there.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 I believe its real world mileage beats most other trucks.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 That lets the engine dump all that power down to the road without having to stress-out the engine and transmission.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 It is just amazing how easily this truck can get moving.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 The only real changes I'd like to see are with interior material quality.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 It's not like other trucks aren't using cheap materials, but I would expect much more from Toyota.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 The only other things I would like to see improved are AC, radio and Nav control locations for the driver, Some better paint that doesn't chip and scratch so easily and better visibility out the sides and the rear.


hyundai veracruz
1 Curves are as well identified as straight pursuits.This is a worthy competitor to the Audi A6 (had one of them), BMW 5 series (had one of them), and Mercedes E class (had one of them too).

1 Everything else about this truck is great.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 Interior room is astounding, storage space, pockets and cup holders are everywhere, seats are very comfortable, handling is good, turning radius is almost as good as a car, it's bouncy at highway speeds, little unsettled at low speeds, but it's a truck, steering is very precise at any speed, the engine is quiet, powerful and smooth, reliability has been excellent for my truck and the all three company trucks.

hyundai genesis-coupe
2 I'm getting about 15.5 miles per gallon in mixed driving, like the seating position, interior is pretty spacious, it has more storage space and cup holders than most will ever need, turning radius is the best I've ever seen in a large pickup truck, brakes are fade free and strong enough to stop a freight train, ride is good but can be harsh on bad roads, visibility out the rear could be improved, hauls well, but it is kind of tough loading things over the bed rails, an unearthly 5.7L engine and transmission work well to make the truck very quick, towing is a piece of cake for it, steering may feel soft for some people, but I find it very, very responsive, reliability has been excellent...


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 If you're in the market for a truck, I'd tell you to go for a Tundra.

1 Comfortable, reliable, sophisticated, V8 performance with occasional (depending on how hard you press the right pedal...) V4 economy.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 You'll also get Toyota dependability.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 I use my truck for my business daily.

2 The first generation Tundra was too small a truck for what I needed, but it was great for what it was.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 The Chevy did have more room and power, but I was shocked at what an unreliable monster it was.

1 Lots of cargo space, versatility AND comfort in the same package.

1 For a relatively new entry into the full size truck game, the Toyota has definitely raised the bar for the old guard.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 This Truck is wicked fast to me and my other car(s) are a Challenger R/T Hemi and a Hemi Grand Cherokee.


kia rio
1 Car like riding in a smooth and stable platform.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 The Tundra rides and drives like a big Lexus even with the TRD Off Road Tires and suspension.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 I agree with the other reviewers that the visibility could be better and the back-up camera should be standard.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 Mine does not have it and backing up is a anxiety producing endeavor.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 Of the three vehicles, the Tundra is always my first choice even though it is a thirsty beast.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 The Jeep avgs 10-12 mpg city/14-16 Hwy to the Tundra's 13-14 city/17-18 Hwy.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 Not to mention the amazingly quick Toyota service compared to the tortise slow Chrysler service.


kia rio
1 Never had a Avalanche before, but will certainly miss this one when time comes.Getting 15.3MPG City from a 5.3L V8, while the Econocars get 30+ MPG from an engine that has 1/2 of cylinder count and 33% of the engine displacement, seems a very good performance to me.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 Or, to be less critical of the competition, I will say that Toyota gets a lot more right than they get wrong.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 On the highway and even on secondary roads the Tundra seems to shrink in size to a midsize vehicle.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 The steering is very precise and the handling is excellent when you consider the almost 3 tons of real estate you are hurling across the asphalt on 4 little rubber donuts.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 The spacious and airy cabin along with the lack of wind and road noise and the smooth solid ride and good road manners makes long distance travel in the Tundra almost painless.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 Navigating small city streets in heavy traffic, or parking in small tight parkings spaces, not so much.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 In this area, I think all full size pickups become less of a joy and more of a pain to drive so that is not a flaw of the Tundra but a flaw of all big vehicles in general.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 However, I don't think all full size trucks share the Tundra's car like driving and handling attributes.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 Some trucks drive and handle like a truck.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 Which to me means clumsy, imprecise handling, and unpleastant surprises when vehicle is asked to change direction quickly or change direction while braking or God forbid, braking, changing direction, and hitting a bump or two in the road all at the same time."

kia rio
1 I just came out of a lease on a Lincoln Mark LT (a "jazzed up" Ford F150) I was only getting 13mpg and wanted a truck that got better gas milage (gas WAS $4.35 a gallon) I took the avalanche for a real quick test drive, read the reviews, and liked the way it loooked.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 Heating and air conditioning is cab-partitioned and works beautifully.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 Power to burn on acceleration.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 Only negative is fuel consumption (15-17 mpg around town, over 18 mpg on road).


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 Excellent orthopedic seats.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 I was originally looking at 4Runners and other "comparable" 2011 midsize SUVs/Crossovers (Explorer, Pathfinder, Pilot, Grand Cherokee, Etc.).


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 After getting into these vehicles I realized they were all somewhat cramped and I didn't want to get a new vehicle and then put something dirty in it or force something too big in it and mess up the interior.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 I settled on looking a trucks.


kia rio
1 Now that I have it, I wish I would have stayed with the ford.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 Gas mileage, cost and reliability were driving factors for me.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 The Fords and Chevy's had the best mpg ratings so I looked at them first.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 The 4-door Chevy truck wasn't big enough in the back to be a good family vehicle for me.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 I wanted to be able to fit two carseats, 1 person and a couple dogs in the back without too much effort.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 Ford looked great with their new engine lineup (plenty of power and good mpgs), but there were no rebates or incentives when I was looking which resulted in about a $35k vehicle for what I wanted.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 Not only that but I don't want to be the guinea pig for Ford's new engines to see how reliable they were although I really liked the mpg and performance specs.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 At the time Toyota Tundra had a fairly new V8, the 4.6L which is a true DOHC engine and is based on their highly praised 5.7L engine.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 It had already been out for more than a year and I couldn't find any major complaints except for something that had been fixed for the current 2011 model year.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 On top of that there was a $2.5k incentive for the CrewMax which put them in the range of $31k.I made my decision and bought the truck in July and have been driving it for over 3 months now.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 Gas mileage wasn't very good during the initial break-in period, but I'm averaging about 17.5-18mpg now.


kia rio
2 First ... It rides like a truck, (I know ... it is a truck) I need a neck brace to stop my head from bobbing, you feel ever bump.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 There is more than enough room in the back for what I need and although the bed is only 5.5ft long I haven't found a use for anything bigger yet.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 It drives well in the Summer and early fall and I am eager to find out how it handles the winters.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 The only drive-ability gripe I have so far is the due to the trends of auto mfg'ers to add lots of safety gadgets that don't allow you to spin the tires without first turning them off.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 The CrewMax Tundra comes standard with a full power slide-down rear window (I used it pretty much everyday in the Summer) although the A/C occasionally got some use on the really hot days." 2 people out of 2 found this review helpful

hyundai genesis-coupe
2 I have owned all other trucks and I still have a dodge that is in great shape, but I needed something with more power and room.

1 The biggest problem is the gas mileage.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 I average 17mpg and only 12 while towing.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 The truck has plenty of room front and back with lots of bells and whisels.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 However, I only recomend the 5.7 since it has proven better reliability, and the gas mileage is about the same with other engines.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 If you get the crewmax the bed will be too small for 4x8 sheets or stander lumber.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 However, if you are looking for a daily truck with a bit more gas milage and nice looks the GMC Sierra is nice with a comfortable ride.

2 I'm getting about 15.5 miles per gallon in mixed driving, like the seating position, interior is pretty spacious, it has more storage space and cup holders than most will ever need, turning radius is the best I've ever seen in a large pickup truck, brakes are fade free and strong enough to stop a freight train, ride is good but can be harsh on bad roads, visibility out the rear could be improved, hauls well, but it is kind of tough loading things over the bed rails, an unearthly 5.7L engine and transmission work well to make the truck very quick, towing is a piece of cake for it, steering may feel soft for some people, but I find it very, very responsive, reliability has been excellent...

2 The steering is very precise and the handling is excellent when you consider the almost 3 tons of real estate you are hurling across the asphalt on 4 little rubber donuts.

2 The spacious and airy cabin along with the lack of wind and road noise and the smooth solid ride and good road manners makes long distance travel in the Tundra almost painless.


hyundai genesis-coupe
1 Navigating small city streets in heavy traffic, or parking in small tight parkings spaces, not so much.


hyundai genesis-coupe
2 In this area, I think all full size pickups become less of a joy and more of a pain to drive so that is not a flaw of the Tundra but a flaw of all big vehicles in general.

hyundai genesis-coupe
1 Some trucks drive and handle like a truck.

1 Ford looked great with their new engine lineup (plenty of power and good mpgs), but there were no rebates or incentives when I was looking which resulted in about a $35k vehicle for what I wanted.

1 Seating comfort is MUCH better than 2001 but the distance from bottom of driver/ front pax door sill to top of sill is shorter than Ford/Chevy so you have to bend your head a bit to climb in if you are tall (6'-3'').

1 I was hoping Honda would get with the times and build something innovative like an AWD Sport-Sedan Utility Vehicle.Toyota beat them to it.


hyundai tucson
2 I chose a 4cyl premium package which included Panoramic roof, leather, Backup Camera, electric hatch and a bunch of other things.


hyundai tucson
1 The drivetrain is really well matched(engine and transmission) Shifts well, accelerates quickly and I can pass anything on the highway.


hyundai tucson
1 Ride comfort on long trips is exceptionally good.


hyundai tucson
1 The back seat room is incredible and with the theatre reclining seating, it's like flying first-class.There are 3 cons as I see it, the first one is in the trim department; the dash components are poorly fitted... things like vent bezels, speaker grills on the dash.. they are misaligned... no ball bearing test there.The next con is the factory tires.


hyundai tucson
2 I really noticed the ride quality improvement when in Winter, I put Blizzaks on this car and it was actually quieter than the Bridgestone Dueler HL400's that came on it.


hyundai tucson
1 One positive aspect of ownership is that there are many choices for replacement tires now.


kia sedona
2 I am on my 4th one since they came out!


hyundai tucson
1 Goodyear Assurance Tripletreads would be a very good all season M S tire for this car I believe.If there was something I'd like to see improved other than above, it would be more intuitive/ergonomic heater controls.


hyundai tucson
2 3 years and I can't set it without staring at it for 15 seconds.Also, the mirror defrost is part of the rear window defrost circuit but the button only shows the rear window icon.


hyundai tucson
2 Maybe toyota could add a mirror icon to that button?The rear wiper control always confuses me because the thinking is opposite of what's natural to me.

hyundai tucson
1 All in all, the Venza is the best of them all.


hyundai tucson
1 We've loved our Avalons, and the Venza is a little bit like the Avalon perfected.


hyundai tucson
1 The Venza has no-apologies room, especially the back seat, power, good economy for the size, room, and power, and it is a pleasure on the road.

2 Mine is the V-6 AWD, and I think it was a great choice.


hyundai tucson
2 Mine is black, and I've made it my "second job" to keep it shining; I added some chrome as well.


hyundai tucson
1 It looks sharp!! I think the Toyota advertising misses the mark, and I'd feel better if the focus was on the fact that while it does everything you want from most any SUV, but with a much sportier look, contrasted to the cargo box-truck look of many SUVs.


hyundai tucson
2 Ironically, my only disappointment is a wider turning radius than it should have.It's a great road-trip car, safe, dependable, reliable, roomy, yet with decent mileage.


hyundai tucson
1 It really is the Avalon perfected: easier in and out with a higher vantage, good ground clearance but with a low center of gravity and excellent driving characteristics, a good ride, tons of space, and AWD.

hyundai tucson
1 The interior of the car is where the issues come to play.


hyundai tucson
1 The interior is made with very low quality materials.


hyundai tucson
1 Lots of hard plastics and low quality leather.


hyundai tucson
1 The Venza has a very firm ride which causes the interior of the car, mainly the dash, and the passenger seat to rattle.

1 It was instant love!


kia sedona
2 Great truck overall, however I have had some maintence issues since i've owned it.


hyundai tucson
2 The "look" is very appealing; it is very roomy; it does not sit as low as a car, but not as high as some SUV's; gets good gas mileage; is priced reasonably; plus, it handles great!


hyundai tucson
1 As for the design, there are no blind spots; which is something I am very particular about.


hyundai tucson
2 Also, several years ago, I owned a Volkswagen Jetta TDI and when I drove it on the interstate, with posted speed limits higher than 55 mph, I could feel the car literally "lighten up" the faster I drove.


hyundai tucson
1 With the Venza, you do not get the "lighter" feeling...in fact, with the design, it seems to hold the road just as well at 70+ as it does at 55.


hyundai tucson
2 I would definitely encourage anyone who is interested in a luxury car to give the Venza a test drive...it has all the "bells and whistles" at a fraction of the price!" 11 people out of 11 found this review helpful

2 This car is just right for me, it gets good gas milage 29.5 on I95 and I75 from Florida thru Georga, The hills in WVA and Ohio are a little diffrent cuts gas milage to 25, and makes it over the Mts with power to spare.In town Tampa Fl it gets 21.5 and that stopping for all the red lights and traffic jams.The 19 inch wheels have been dust free no breaK DUST since I have had it March 2010.Also it is very quiet driving,The stearing takes a little getting use to but after a few weeks that to is great."

hyundai veloster
1 The JBL 13 Speaker Navigation is great.


hyundai veloster
2 The Bluetooth streaming works well with my iPod Touch playing music without wires.


hyundai veloster
2 The Backup camera is a good feature so you don't run over your kids or grandma pulling out of the driveway but too hard for parking cuz no guide lines like Morano and such.


hyundai veloster
2 The 4 cyl is a great deal/value if you are frugal and don't need the stuff but the one I bought gets pricey since with the package adds another 8k.


hyundai veloster
1 I was thinking of the Acura MDX but after adding the same options, it was about 15k more with less like pana roof.

hyundai veloster
2 All-in-all, I bought it cuz of my new born son so minivan or SUV or something in between.


hyundai veloster
2 Easy to get in and the cargo is low enough for my 5' wife to throw the stroller in easily with out a forklift.


hyundai veloster
1 The back facing infant seat is tight and only can fit on either side of the back seat rather than the middle.


hyundai veloster
1 The front passenger seat hits it when leaning it back at a normal decline but still enough space if not going to sleep upfront.


hyundai veloster
2 There is some wind and road noise on my AWD V6 but not bad.


hyundai veloster
1 Besides, I have the 16 spkrs blasting anyway when baby is not with me.


hyundai veloster

hyundai veracruz
1 It gets pretty good gas mileage (it averages about 22 city and probably 26 highway), and handles well.


hyundai veracruz
2 Replacing its tires is one of the exceptions -- the tire size (245/55/19) makes the replacements super expensive (about $200/tire).

2 The car has plenty of room for a family of 4-5, we have a family of 3 and it really worked out well for us.


hyundai veracruz
1 The only reason we got rid of it was because of an uninsured old lady(76 yrs old).

1 She ran a red light at 50mph and collided into me on the drivers side, causing the car to roll over and slide on its roof for several meters.

2 The car handled the collision marvelously and I walked away from the accident with nothing but a couple scrapes on my elbows and a seatbelt burn from the locking and subsequent jerking of my shoulder back into the seat, and not to mention the hanging upside down part of my story.

2 Unfortunately, the car was totalled by my insurance company, and so my wife and I are going to be in the market for another one.

hyundai veracruz
1 We test drove the 4runner, the highlander, the sequoia, even the Camry.


hyundai veracruz
2 But then we forgot about this new crossover they came out with a few years ago, and looked into the Venza.


hyundai veracruz
2 Instantly we were in love.


hyundai veracruz
1 The look on the outside is real sharp, even for a Toyota, which is historically known for conservative looking cars.


hyundai veracruz
1 You immediately notice the full front wrap chrome grill, accompanied with impressive 20" chrome wheels (the 5 spoke one) and it just looks sharp.


hyundai veracruz
1 It looks classy like a Lexus RX with a little of sportiness like the matrix.


hyundai veracruz
2 The spoiler gives it a snazzy look, and the option we chose with the panoramic sun roof / moon roof is real sharp looking.


hyundai veracruz
1 The interior is spacious, almost like traveling in a first class air plane.


kia sedona
1 It floats down the highway and the power is amazing.


hyundai veracruz
1 It's huge!


hyundai veracruz
1 Plenty of room for 5 people, or in our case, 2 adults, 2 kids and a dog.


hyundai veracruz
2 We chose the leather / wood grain upgrade, very very comfortable and great looking.


hyundai veracruz
1 The center console is super innovative, with the 14 liter of space available to put all kinds of stuff.


hyundai veracruz
1 The cord management for your iPods / iPhones is a great plus too.


hyundai veracruz
1 The standard audio is pretty clear sounding with nice bass, as well as the Bluetooth option for calls and for streaming your music (gets rid of the use of an auxiliary cord).


hyundai veracruz
1 The only con that we figured out, was the loss of a 3rd row, but we expected that when were looking at crossovers.In the end, if you want the reliability of a Toyota, a car that looks impressive and not to "mommy" and a big enough vehicle for a family with decent MPG, then the Venza is top notch.


hyundai veracruz
2 We also opted for the V6 AWD, which was my push not the wifes.


hyundai veracruz
2 The extra pick up of the V6 and maneuverability of the AWD was a must in my opinion, but the other versions were decently capable."


kia sedona
1 Effortless acceleration and amazing comfort with tons of room.


hyundai veracruz
1 I don't like the back up camera, and there are some blind spots you have to get used to (adding small mirror to side mirrors helps), but it drives like a dream with good pick up, and is comfortable.


hyundai veracruz
1 enough room in the back for dogs.


hyundai veracruz
1 It is a Toyota, so I suspect it will last many years.


hyundai veracruz
1 Gas milage isn't great...17 city, 24 highway.


hyundai veracruz
2 I've only had my 2013 gray XLE AWD for a few days and I like it alot.


hyundai veracruz
2 I'm a car guy who loves looking, reading about and test driving cars, so when it came time to replace my company car I had checked out seemingly everything out there.


hyundai veracruz
1 I was looking for a reasonably affordable, fun to drive, good looking car with real world versatility and Toyota nailed it.In terms of looks, its in the eye of the beholder, I realize, but I think the Venza is one of the best looking cars on the road regardless of category or price range.


hyundai veracruz
1 The design is an exemplary example of form following function; great lines without being over-styled.


hyundai veracruz
2 The styling details, sheet metal work coupled with the nice details like the alloy wheels, some of the best looking out there, the dual chrome tipped exhaust chrome accents on the door pulls and the redesigned grill all work together extremely well.


kia sedona
1 This truck looks great too.


hyundai veracruz
1 Some critics have comment that interior materials are not up to par with competitive models.


hyundai veracruz
1 I'll concede the point but the interior is laid out very well and the fit and finish are tight and top notch.Whereas some car companies apparently believe that cluttered confusion is synonymous with sophistication, the gauges and controls in the Venza are a study in simplicity; logical and easy to use, The seats are well designed and comfortable.


hyundai veracruz
1 I'm 6'-6" tall and very comfortable (no sunroof though!) although I could use just a bit more travel both back and down with the power seat.


hyundai veracruz
1 Even with my seat all the way back there's ample room for even someone my size to sit behind the driver.The Venza has thoughtful handy features like fold down rear seats with the flip of the lever as well as reclining rear seats and power tail gate.


hyundai veracruz
2 The XLE has home link which I really appreciate and the Entune audio/Nav system with backup camera is well designed.


hyundai veracruz
1 The only feature missing are back-up sensors.


hyundai veracruz
2 Given the Venza's maneuverability they may not be as essential as on larger vehicles but they're definitely nice to have.


hyundai veracruz
1 The XLE has smart key technology with push button start which is nice.


hyundai veracruz
1 I had remote start added by the dealer.


hyundai veracruz
1 It's integrated into the same fob and works flawlessly.Driving the Venza is very satisfying.


kia sedona
1 I don't think Ford or Dodge has anything near as stylish as the Avalanche.


hyundai veracruz
2 I did not drive the 4 which supposedly more than adequate but the six is great.


hyundai veracruz
2 The Venza is very quick and despite its weight, feel light and nimble.


hyundai veracruz
1 Again some critics have taken shots at if for not being a true sports wagon in which you can carve through the back roads on weekends.


hyundai veracruz
1 Maybe so, but compared to all of the SUV's I test drove, the Venza feels like Porsche 911.


hyundai veracruz
1 it's a reasonable tradeoff for the great looking rims.Only having the Venza for a few days, I can't comment on reliability but given our experience with Toyota and their reputation for trouble free driving i am not expecting to have too many issues.


hyundai veracruz
2 MPG is rated at 19-25 and it will be interesting to see how accurate it is.


hyundai veracruz
1 It runs on regular octane which was a must for me.Interestingly, a number of Venza owners have bemoaned the way Toyota has marketed the Venza as the ideal ride for empty nesters; contending that the approach hurts its cache, its appeal and overall "cool" quotient.


hyundai veracruz
1 Well, the fact is, that it is a great option for people in that demographic but its also a great choice for young couples with or without a child or two.


hyundai veracruz
1 The Venza is a very appealing ride that will work well in the real world for a lot of life styles.


kia sedona
2 I have never been completely satisfied with any vehicle I have owned until now.


hyundai veracruz

hyundai veracruz
1 Dream car was Lexus RX 350, was to settle on Honda CRV until I found this one by recommendation of Lexus "guy".


hyundai veracruz
1 I test drove the RX several times and only took me one time to drive the Venza and I was sold.


hyundai veracruz
1 Many of the same features as the RX, drives/handles just as smooth and $10k + less.

1 There is absolutely nothing I don't love about my Avalanche.


hyundai veracruz
1 I got the upscale version, 20in rims, JBL system, panaromic roof, comfort #2 package.


hyundai veracruz
1 I was worried about the 20in rims/tires and took out the "tire" insurance to cover those (inexpensive in comparision to replacement).


hyundai veracruz

1 This is my fifth Toyota purchased since 1973.


hyundai veracruz
1 It is good looking, the handling feel is excellent, and the comfort and convenience features are surprisingly nice for a basic model.


kia sedona
1 Glad I got that option.


hyundai veracruz
2 I'm a really big guy (think NFL lineman) and I find the steering wheel adjustment range to be a little tight for easy entry and egress, but good for driving.


hyundai veracruz
2 Fuel economy is good (avg 24+mpg overall) and passengers (front and rear) have universally acclaimed the comfortable seating and convenience features.


hyundai veracruz
1 The "low-end" sound system is very good, and satellite radio is also very good.


hyundai veracruz
2 I've never had that before, and I will pay the subscription to keep it.


hyundai veracruz
1 The back-up camera display is too small and unreadable in direct sunlight, but covers all the necessary viewing angles.


hyundai veracruz
1 Otherwise, the controls are readable, intuitive and easy to use.


hyundai veracruz
2 I need to read the manual and learn more about the "parking assist" feature, which may be related to the "hill hold" feature and which operates at times that seem unpredictable to me.


hyundai veracruz
1 Once I understand why and how they are activated, I'll probably use this feature on purpose.


hyundai veracruz
1 The 6-speed automatic transmission with on-demand AWD is exceptionally smooth-shifting and is biased toward lower rpms and higher fuel economy, which I expected and is OK with me.


hyundai veracruz
2 If I need to "get the heck out of the way" the accelerator works well and the tranny responds quickly.


kia sedona
2 The day after we picked up our new Avalanche, we took a trip to Texas to visit some friends and it got 22 mpg which was nearly as good as my wife's Taurus gets.


hyundai veracruz
2 It's not a dragster, but that's not what I needed or expected.


hyundai veracruz
2 I'm looking forward to the snow season here in the southern Oregon mountains to see how it handles with snow tires and AWD.

hyundai veracruz
2 Have had the vehicle for 4 months.


hyundai veracruz
2 Vehicle was purchased with V6 AWD.


hyundai veracruz
1 LX, NV, PC, SR, DK, Z1 package and added the remote start system.Complaints: Remote start system stops as soon as you open the door.


kia optima
1 The car now has 6 speeds which is a nice addition for 2012.


kia sedona
1 I am totally sold and will be an Avalanche fan/owner for life.


hyundai veracruz
1 This is an annoying feature.


hyundai veracruz
2 I own aftermarket remote start systems on two separate vehicles, the remote start system on aftermarket system only stops if you step on the brakes w/o the key in the ignition.Steering lacks good feedback.The Navi system is an extremely poor design.


hyundai veracruz
1 The screen is about 1/2 inch from the front bezel.


hyundai veracruz
1 This makes it EXTREMELY difficult to push the bottom of the touch screen without angling your fingers.


hyundai veracruz
1 Your fingers will hit the edge of the bezel and may require trying to push the functions twice or more.


hyundai veracruz
1 Geez...


hyundai veracruz
1 I have an 06 4Runner with Navi and that was done right.


hyundai veracruz
2 My Honda civic with Navi was done right.$4,345


kia optima
2 This is my 4th one.


hyundai veracruz
1 2006 4Runner Limited comes with dual seat memory.


hyundai veracruz
1 :(OK.. those are my only complaints: 1) Remote Start should remain on even after you enter the vehicle.


hyundai veracruz
2 If the vehicle does not sense key inside the car (keyless go) then it should turn off when brake is applied.


hyundai veracruz
1 2) Forget the electric drive by wire steering system - give us something that provides feedback to driver.


hyundai veracruz
1 It's a good try to make it speed sensitive but the 4Runner provides good feedback, Venza doesn't.


hyundai veracruz
1 3) Do something about the Touch Screen Navigation system.


hyundai veracruz
1 Make the screen flush with the dash so the user doesn't have to work weird angle to touch the bottom part of the screen.


hyundai veracruz
2 4. Give us two memories for the driver seats as often in a family vehicle the mom and the dad swaps out as driver.


hyundai veracruz
2 Is this such a surprise????The goods...1) Power!!!


hyundai veracruz
2 The V6 power is addicting.


kia sedona
1 Wouldn't own anything else.


hyundai veracruz
1 It's faster (at least feels that way) than the 2006 V8 4Runner.


hyundai veracruz
1 I am still breaking in but I get better gas mileage on the V8 4-Runner where I average 16.7mpg all around.


hyundai veracruz
1 On the Venza I have been getting 16.4 mpg.


hyundai veracruz
1 I expect the mpg to get better in time.


hyundai veracruz
1 On the Highway cruising ... the instant mpg usually reads around 25-27mpg on a flat surface.


hyundai veracruz
2 I have low mpg average because I have a lead foot and is probably using most if not all the 268HP majority of the time.


hyundai veracruz
1 The accelerating is intoxicating for a heavy family hauler.Very good JBL audio system.


hyundai veracruz
1 It's worth the upgrade.


hyundai veracruz
1 Good bluetooth interface with the ipHones... can connect to both his and her iphones but not at the same time.


hyundai veracruz
1 USB plug is a plus as you can have a 16GB thumbdrive full of MP3 music to select from on the touch screen.


kia sedona
1 I have owned top of the line ford, dodges and chevy trucks.


hyundai veracruz
1 Bad: Because of the location of the USB plug, it interferes with closing of the center storage door.


hyundai veracruz
1 Any average USB plug will interfere... Toyota if you're reading this, move the USB plug elsewhere so that it doesn't interferes with moving surface.


hyundai veracruz
1 I bet that part wasn't tested.Panoramic roof is sweet.


hyundai veracruz
2 The kids love it.Missing---for such a big vehicle, give us parking sensors.


hyundai veracruz
1 This vehicle is long...and HARD to park (relatively speaking).


hyundai veracruz
1 Compared to a 4Runner, the 4Runner is EASY to park as it has good turning radius, this Venza does not.


hyundai veracruz
2 Neither my wife or I have any problem parking but you have to swing wide and/or have to back in and out couple times in certain parking spots that a Tundra (we also own) or a 4Runner can park with one try.


hyundai veracruz
1 That speaks volume about this vehicle's parking radius.


hyundai veracruz
2 These aren't really complaints but little nuances about the vehicle.


hyundai veracruz
1 Most of my thoughts here are random.


kia sedona
1 This beats them all.


hyundai veracruz
1 Sorry, I hope this add value to your decision if you are thinking about this vehicle.Power rear door is a plus.


hyundai veracruz
2 My wife loves it!


hyundai veracruz
2 You can open and close the trunk remotely.


hyundai veracruz
1 Yes many SUVs have this feature but this was our first so really like it.Back seats have lots of room.. more room that the people out front, it seems like.


hyundai veracruz
2 Back seats also reclines.The trunk is not VERY huge but it is very adequate.


hyundai veracruz
1 Consider this carefully... if you purchase the Panoramic roof you will not be able to install roof racks.


hyundai veracruz
1 If you need roof racks for any reason you should consider NO panoramic roof.


hyundai veracruz
1 Also Panoramic roof DOESN'T allow for Toyota (factory) rear entertainment system.


hyundai veracruz
2 You can get aftermarket ones that utilizes the headrest cushion but not the factory rear entertainment system.In the end....


hyundai veracruz
2 As much as I like the Venza and have very little regret as I purchased a $40K (msrp) Venza for ~$35K and has many bells and whistles we have not had before.... if I can do it again I probably would have picked up the V6 Rav4 or the Highlander instead.But...... the Venza is a very capable vehicle that we chose over a very closely equipped Nissan Maxima and Infiniti G37 Sports as a family hauler.

2 Dont hesitate to drive one soon.


hyundai veracruz
1 The ride on relatively smooth roads is rock solid and the V-6 and 6 speed transmission are well matched and provide ample power.


hyundai veracruz
2 The Venza is not promoted as a sport wagon but it's quick and nimble and actually kind of fun to drive.


hyundai veracruz
2 The seats are comfortable and the back seat is extremely roomy.


hyundai veracruz
2 Rear doors open about as wide as I've seen any rear doors open.


hyundai veracruz
1 If you don't want to be driving the same car everyone else is driving Venza sightings while not rare are far less frequent that Highlanders, Rav4's, 4runners or even FJ Cruisers.On the negative side, the power seats need more adjustabilty, down and back.


hyundai veracruz
2 The power slider on the passenger side only moves back and forth; unacceptable in a car with a $36K MSRP.


hyundai veracruz
1 Turn signals do not have the lane change feature that allows you to hit it once for a three or so flashes; annoying.


hyundai veracruz
1 More annoying is that the directionals won't click off after the more gradual turn on to an entry or exit ramp.


hyundai veracruz
1 That coupled with the fact that the click sound is soft and dead, easily masked by music or road noise, added with the fact that I hold the wheel at a point that blocks my view of the flasher means that I frequently find myself driving for extended distances with my turn signal on!


hyundai veracruz
1 There's too much wind noise from the mirrors.


kia sedona
1 You will be impressed amd buy one.


hyundai veracruz
1 In some cross winds I find myself checking windows even still, thinking one has to be open a bit.


hyundai veracruz
1 There's also a fair amount of road noise and what really shocked me was the first time I drove over recently salted roads.


hyundai veracruz
1 The salt thrown up from the rear tires and hitting the wheel wells sounded like gravel shaken inside an empty coffee can.


hyundai veracruz
2 While it handles surprisingly well the 20" tires make for a jarring ride over rough pavement; very trucklike.


hyundai veracruz
1 The rear camera is a nice idea but clouds and blurs from moisture running down the lift gate and there's no rear sensors.


hyundai veracruz
1 And then there's the dashboard.


hyundai veracruz
1 I didn't inspect it closely (I guess i presumed certainly things are a given) as the overall look is nice, clean and functional if not elegant.


hyundai veracruz
1 The fit is simply substandard.


hyundai veracruz
1 The seams, and there are lots of them, around the vents and speaker grills are uneven and gapped.


hyundai veracruz
1 The dash is a soft touch material but with a wierd grainy texture like you might find in vinyl siding.


kia optima
1 The exterior styling is better than the 2011 but still is not yet perfect.

hyundai veracruz
1 And the biggest disappointment to date is the mileage.


hyundai veracruz
1 Granted I haven't done a ton of highway driving but I'm averaging less than 18 mpg: had I known I wouldn't have considered the Venza.


hyundai veracruz
1 The 2013 Venza received a mild cosmetic makeover; the first since introduced in 2009.


hyundai veracruz
2 If Toyota is interested in keeping this model in the lineup they need to go much deeper with the modifications.

1 Overall, a good value for the money.Cruise Control does not function like all German cars I've previously owned - it's basically worthless on long trips.


hyundai veracruz
2 When set, it will control speed going up-hill and on flat stretches, but any downhill stretch (or slight decline in the slope of the road) results in acceleration that "cruise control" does not act upon.


hyundai veracruz
1 One must manually use brake to bring speed down to the set limit.Dealer said "that's the way it works".


hyundai veracruz
1 Cruise Control feature is not intended to be used in any downhill situation.

2 I rented many vehicles from Enterprise and Hertz to "live with" all the models I was considering (and to see how they had held-up with all the different crazy drivers they see), and the Yaris' were always "tight and right" regardless of how many rental-car thrashing miles were on them...except one particular Yaris (I rented 3 different Yaris' once I narrowed my search down) that had been wrecked and had a very worn tire that roared on the highway.


scion xd
1 But it still drove pretty good considering what it had been through and they were still renting it out.


scion xd
1 This is not a high volume seller for Toyota because of the Corolla and Prius C being priced slightly higher than the Yaris.


scion xd
1 That is a shame, for it might possibly be one of their best built cars.


scion xd
2 I love the fact that it has the bullet-proof 1.5L engine and old-tech transmission that have been around for "many" years with used one's out there in the 300+ thousand- mile range with very little (if any) problems.


scion xd
1 Plenty of space for larger people, great legroom in back.


scion xd
2 Trunk space kinda small with rear seats up, but fold them down?....and you get a "lot" of room back there (enough for two people to go to the beach for a week or camping for a week).


scion xd
1 Rides great, gas mileage is great, it is pretty quiet on the road (never understood how the Car Magazines said it is noisy....try a Rio5 when it is cold...sounds like a blender grating ice.

kia sedona
2 The lines, stance and 20" wheels really make it stand out from the crowd.The drive is truly fantastic, too.


scion xd
1 And many small cars are going to that Gas Direct Injection...except the Yaris..."yay").


scion xd
1 The old-tech transmission on the Yaris is a smooth, very simple automatic transmission that does not need 5th or 6th gearing.


scion xd
2 It is a road cruiser!


scion xd
1 It keeps up with and passes traffic plenty-fine...quite peppy once broken-in correctly!


scion xd
2 The simplicity of the car is what attracted me compared to Rio5, Accent, Fiesta, Fiat, Versa and Fit.


scion xd
2 Did not try the Mazda2 due to past experience with that company.


scion xd
1 The Yaris' just felt better built than those others and too many features eventually break after time and are not cheap to fix.


scion xd
2 The only thing I do not like is that the dash and door panels can mark-up easily (have to keep a microfiber towel around) and the bluetooth has cut-out on me once in a while...probably the fault of my flip phone and no tachometer except on the SE Model.


scion xd
1 But I do enjoy this car.


scion xd
2 Sure, I could have bought something more exciting, but the Yaris is fun, simple, comfortable and the "VERY Simple Maintenance" requirements make it a great value as well.

1 The Yaris is so tiny yet so practical in every way imaginable.You can park this thing anywhere, the turning radius allows you to pull a U-turn on any street, and the handling feels like a much more expensive sport hatch.

2 Granted, mind is a manual which gives me an edge, but it's just so much fun to drive and doesn't break the bank.I was amazed at how much storage space there is inside; they put compartments everywhere, even a second glove box behind the steering wheel.

1 I'm hoping that it will be as reliable as my last two Mazda's, as I'm planning on keeping this car in my family for many years to come.So if you've been looking for an incredibly fun to drive sports car that won't guzzle gas, this is definitely your best choice.

2 Exterior looks are out of this world, 3 yrs later i still get looks, and comments on how amazing it is- Interior dash/doro panels are flimsy looking, and if it is a daily driver will see lots of scratches on doors and plastic- the trunk is pretty big but the opening is silly..makes for 'tetris' like moments- The BA speaker upgrade is ok, but not worth the cost- The stock exhaust note from the V6 sounds thin; after market exhauts makes a huge difference- Back seat, painful- Driver comfort is amazing...lots of room.-

2 1st, beware, the cup holders are placed right behind the shifter which is very annoying if you own a manual transmission.


kia sedona

kia sedona
2 It is a great car but if you have ever owned a convertible (especially a mustang) you will notive a considerable difference in the quality of the top.


kia sedona
1 If you don't put the boot on (which GM says is not a requirement and even sells some without a boot) you will notice considerible shaking of the top when it is in the down position while driving.


kia sedona
1 It shakes up and down and is a distraction in the rearview mirror.

2 I have had 3 mustang convertibles (94, 99, and 06 models) and none of them ever did this.

kia sorento
1 I had done a lot of research going in to the purchase and I went in with some reservations based on different reviews I had read.


kia sorento
2 Pretty much all my concerns evaporated when I actually got behind the wheel and drove the thing.The most consistent negative comments I came across were regarding the visibility factor.


kia sorento
2 While the visibility is slightly less than what I'm used to, I can say that visibility is not restricted to what I NEED to see.


kia sorento
1 True, the large C pillar does create a bit of a blind spot to the back right, but when you are actually moving on the road this is not that big of an issue, as objects quickly pass from the side front window to the rear window to the rear windshield past the blind spot.


kia sorento
1 Also if you adjust your side mirrors properly where the side of the car is out of view, between your rear windshield, mirrors, and peripheral vision, you should have NO blind spots whatsoever.


kia sorento
1 Backing up is not as bad as I've read, and with the help of a rear vision system is easier than my toyota corolla.


kia sorento
1 I've also read that driving and visibility is difficult for shorter people because of the high dashboard; however, the seat has an "up/down" function, and my wife who is 5'2 has no problem with visibility as long as she moves the seat up.I've also heard about the "horrible interior".


kia sorento
1 I actually find it quite nice.


kia sorento
2 It is quite simple, but I wonder how this can be criticized so vehemently.


kia sorento
1 You are not going to be spending time in the car watching movies on the standard big screen tv monitor or watching a disco ball drop down from the ceiling.


kia sorento
1 You should be sitting in the car to look *out* of the car as you're driving!


kia sorento
2 The central audio console doesn't have billions of cryptic buttons, but is very functional, and you can control a lot of features of the audio system, Bluetooth (which is standard on all models), and even various vehicle functions from a fairly simple console.Also while I really enjoyed test driving the mustang, sitting in the car and handling it on city streets kind of reminded me of sitting in my corolla; it has a small, compact car feel to it.


kia sorento
1 On the other hand, sitting in the camaro truly feels like something different.


kia sorento
2 It has a bigger meaner feel, which some reviewers have viewed as a negative, but I truly find to be one of the more exciting characteristics of driving it.So

1 After one year and 10K miles - it still brings a smile to my face when I open the garage.Have owned many other performance vehicles, and this is at the top of the list regarding bang for the buck.Many armchair folks like to say this or that about the performance aspectrs, styling, or car to car match ups - the net net is that if you actually owned/drove one regularly, you would say that it is a welll made car.Of course there are some items I woud change, tweak, or remove - but that's just my opinion.


kia sorento
2 Mine is a RS/2SS manual w/o the sunroof - suits me just fine - great gas mileage (if you actually follow that stuff for a performance car), great handling, and a blast to drive.

2 The V6 cranks out 312 horse power while maintaining a fuel economy of 21.5mpg city and 29mpg hwy.This car is crazy quick.


kia optima
1 Will highly recommend the TL.


kia sorento
1 The acceleration is unbelievable and is only surpassed by it's ability to handle winding roads.


kia sorento
1 As soon as the engine reaches 2500rpm, it reaches a power band that will whip your head into the head rest and bring a perm-a-smile to your face.


kia sorento
2 The traction control glues the car to the road.


kia sorento
1 I have (on several occasions) taken a 45mph on-ramp at 70mph without so much as a chirp from the tires.


kia sorento
1 It is like driving an overpowered street legal go-kart, and I feel as excited as a 5 year old at Christmas every time I get to drive it.The interior is plush.


kia sorento
2 The RS package comes fully loaded with leather, heated seats, premium sound system, rear spoiler, awesome looking head lights and the coolest part is the heads up display (HUD).


kia sorento
1 It makes you feel like you are flying a fighter jet.Every one complains about blind spots in the car.


kia sorento
1 There are a number of them IF you do not use your mirrors.


kia sorento
1 But with proper use of the mirrors, I have not had any issues with visibility.As a daily driver, the manual tranny is a little frustrating in traffic, but that is true of any manual.

1 Let me start by saying that I am reviewing a sports car and am comparing it (mostly) to other sports cars.I have the 2SS/RS Manual Six-Speed.Value - I think it is the best value vs. performance of any car I'll ever own.Reliability - I haven't had any problems with it so far.


kia sorento
1 However, I haven't owned it long enough to be able to give a 5 star.Quality - It's not a luxury car and I don't pretend it should be.


kia sorento
1 There are little squeaks here and there but I am very happy with the quality for the price I paid.Performance - This is what you buy this car for!

acura mdx
1 I love it!


kia sorento
2 However, I am also glad that I didn't get this car as a younger man because saying "no" to the ponies would have been much more difficult.Styling - I love the retro look harkening back to the Camaro that I've always loved.Comfort - For what it is, I find it very comfortable.


kia sorento
1 I don't expect full size adults to ride in the back seat.


kia sorento
2 I don't take it out for luxury cruises.


kia sorento
1 I've never been uncomfortable in this car.Overall - A lot of people talk about the view from the cockpit.


kia sorento
1 I don't find this to be an issue.


kia sorento
1 It only took a few weeks to get used to and if you use your mirrors well, it's not a problem.I really only have one critique.


kia sorento
1 It's the large rearview mirror (w/OnStar) that blocks a right hand turn.


kia sorento
1 I am used to it now, but a smaller mirror would open up that right hand side immensely.FYI: My fuel economy is 18 city and 26 highway, a little better than average."

1 If you enjoy this (I do) then this is a big plus.-

2 Plenty of V6 Power.

2 Not as much as the Mustang V6 but still plenty.-

1 I submitted a review on this car recently after having had two problems with it - both sloppy workmanship.


kia sorento
2 I bought it in March.


kia sorento
1 It's July and there are a total of four problems now.


kia sorento
1 After the steering wheel began to squeak I learned that it was coming from the steering gear pinion seal and the noise traveled up from there.


kia sorento
2 So the car was in the dealership all day and had to have the steering gear replaced.


kia sorento
1 That was last week.


kia sorento
2 Today I noticed that some kind of weather seal at the bottom of the inside window has come loose and is laying on the dashboard.

kia sorento
2 This car is 4 months old.


kia sorento
1 So while it's still fun to drive and beautiful looking, I'm spending too much time getting it repaired.


kia sorento
1 I'm not paying money, but a new car should be put together better than this.


kia sorento
1 So I have decided that I am not going to recommend this car to anyone.


kia sorento
1 I've even told someone at work who was thinking about buying it that they should reconsider.


kia sorento
1 Maybe this is just a lemon.


kia sorento
1 But I will not keep this car one day longer than the warranty period.

kia optima
1 Whenever we use leather wipes it streaks.


kia sorento
1 But I think the interior could use some enhancements - like a place for sunglasses or lights by the mirror and in the glove box.


kia sorento
1 These are not fancy things - they are features that are in almost all cars -- but not this one.


kia sorento
2 On the sloppy workmanship - I've owned this car for less than 2 months and have had to take it back twice.


kia sorento
2 First, the clear edging around the door was not installed properly in the factory, so I had to have it redone.


kia sorento
1 Then, the spoiler came loose.


kia sorento
1 There are 4 screws and nuts.


kia sorento
1 One was there and tight, one had no nut at all, one had a loose nut and one had such a loose nut that it came off in 6 weeks of ownership.


kia sorento
1 Had to get that fixed.


kia sorento
1 And something totally unimportant is that some kind of small pieces of paper - looked like part UPC codes or something were still attached under the car and I had to get down there and remove them.


kia sorento
2 That's probably a dealership problem.

1 The gaps are correct and uniform and the body lines such as those in the front all line up properly.

1 The interior is of high quality from the seats to the trim even if plastic has a subtle look that doesn't make it feel very plasticy.

1 If you pull up a chair and look at your 2011 Camaro in your driveway you will see all the great design, from the design in the front with its rise in the hood to the slightly flaring fenders swooping back to meet the doors to the shouldered rear fenders curving back in at the bottom to form the back, to the windshield and roof design.


kia sorento
1 A well built and amazing exterior like no other vehicle.


kia sorento
1 The interior keeps this theme with a driver friendly interior.


kia sorento
1 All controls are all well laid out and within easy reach, the materials feel great from the seats to the dash and the view out from the interior when driving is really an amazing experience.


kia sorento
1 The interior has a excellent built quality, excellent driving view with no blind spots with properly adjusted mirrors, excellent sound system and road noise is next to none.


kia sorento
2 Providing a quite, comfortable, visual appealing commute.Comfort and Convenience:My 2011 Camaro with the high quality interior and excellent suspension provides a comfortable, smooth, and quite ride while on the freeway with responsive handling and power train when called a pon in cornering situations or during a daily commute.


kia sorento
1 When driving long distances you get a sense that if you went on a long trip you would be very comfortable.The gas mileage is incredible, allowing you to spend more time on the road with your new Camaro and less time at the pump.Overall Rating:5/5 in every category, this is my first Chevrolet and I am a very proud owner of a 2011 Chevrolet Camaro.

kia sorento
2 It took almost a month.After a couple of weeks of hearing that Chevy refused to send the part, I called customer service.


kia sorento
1 The short version of what happened there is that I was referred to a regional rep of some sort named Matt who basically told me that Chevy would handle the situation however it decided and that if and when the car was repaired they would give it back, but that I had no option to refuse to take possession of the car when Chevy would not even offer an explanation of what was wrong or when I could expect it to be fixed.

2 I never asked for anything more than what I paid for, but I did ask for that.

kia sorento
2 Rarely the truck will randomly not start, I'm still chasing the problem, but I think there is a position sensor or something for the clutch that is preventing the engine from starting.

2 About my 2007 LT 2WD 5 Cylinder Crew cab:I purchased my 3.7L Crew Cab, automatic (O.D.) on July 1, 2007; with one (1) mile in the Odometer.After the first 1K miles I took it across the nation, round trip from Los Angeles to Boston; and back to LA.On return I had logged 13.8K miles.On July 31, 2008 I put the truck in storage and it now has 14.4K miles.During my trip across the nation I began to hear a "Clak" sound every time either front door was opened.

2 /5 CYLINDERS (242 HP) AUTOMATIC:Actually, if you drive it sensibly, and on the open highway set the cruise at 63 MPH, you can get up to 28 MPG; with the tail gate half or fully open.


kia sorento
2 If you have a bed cover, then this does not apply.


kia sorento
2 Another idea to get better MPG is to remove the tail gate all together, unless you need it for holding loads.NOTE: On my return from east to west coast,I loaded my 525 lbs.

1 When you come to a full stop, even if you are not driving fast, you get the feeling that you'll fly out of the windshield!On a 2WD I would recommend installing Heavy Duty Air Shocks in the rear to enhance pay load capabilities.

1 I think it is the nicest looking mid size on the market.If you are not in a hurry, cruise at 63 MPH OR at 5 MPH below the traffic flow.You'll save gas and enjoy this beautiful truck, which lines I could not resist...In all fairness to the reader, it is too early to speak of the truck's long-term performance and reliability."

1 In fact, it's comfortable enough that I'm now using it as my main vehicle so I shrunk my fleet down from three to two vehicles, which further reduced the purchase cost and annual insurance bill by $600.


kia soul
1 However, the 4cyl Automatic shifts frequently on hilly terrain, unless you're running @ 65+ mph otherwise the rpm is too low on the torque curve to pull the hills in Overdrive so now I just shift into 3rd gear to avoid frequent shifts under those conditions which will hopefully extend transmission life.


kia soul
1 I'm sure glad Chevy upgraded the rear axle ratio to 3.73 otherwise it would be intolerable.


kia soul
1 The 3.7L I-5 engine may have been a better choice but that would have been a $2K difference in price under the C-4-C rebate program, which will pay for a lot of gas so I opted for the standard 2.9L I4 engine, which has plenty of power for most of my driving needs.

kia sorento
1 I have keep it clean and done all the required preventative maintenance you are suppose to do.

2 I think it says get out of my way I'm coming through.


kia sorento
2 I do think the inline 5 has good power for what it is.


kia sorento
2 If you compare it to a V8 than it doesn't match up, but I believe the inline 5 matches up to any V6 you put next to it.


kia sorento
2 The only complaint I have about the Colorado is it's interior size, but if you look at any other midsize truck then you get the same amount of space.


kia sorento
2 Overall, I think the Colorado is a great truck and would recommend anyone to buy one if they were in the market for a midsize truck."

2 About my 2007 LT 2WD 5 Cylinder Crew cab:I purchased my 3.7L Crew Cab, automatic (O.D.) on July 1, 2007; with one (1) mile in the Odometer.After the first 1K miles I took it across the nation, round trip from Los Angeles to Boston; and back to LA.On return I had logged 13.8K miles.On July 31, 2008 I put the truck in storage and it now has 14.4K miles.During my trip across the nation I began to hear a "Clak" sound every time either front door was opened.


kia sorento
2 I eventually discovered that the door stoppers' nuts were loose from the factory.I recently discovered that the left front lamp needs replacement; it only works on high-beam mode.My wife complaints about the "noise" it makes on take off.


kia sorento
1 She also complaints about the poor gas mileage.


kia sorento
1 She does have a heavier foot than I do!3.7L


kia sorento
1 I was sad to see it trimed down on the 2011 model.Now it just blends in with the other models.


kia sorento
2 /5 CYLINDERS (242 HP) AUTOMATIC:Actually, if you drive it sensibly, and on the open highway set the cruise at 63 MPH, you can get up to 28 MPG; with the tail gate half or fully open.


kia sorento
2 If you have a bed cover, then this does not apply.


kia sorento
2 Another idea to get better MPG is to remove the tail gate all together, unless you need it for holding loads.NOTE: On my return from east to west coast,I loaded my 525 lbs.


kia sorento
2 motorcycle; which resulted on a 4 MPG drop.My one major concern is the clumsiness of the brakes.


kia sorento
1 When you come to a full stop, even if you are not driving fast, you get the feeling that you'll fly out of the windshield!On a 2WD I would recommend installing Heavy Duty Air Shocks in the rear to enhance pay load capabilities.


kia sorento
1 I would also install beefy (front & Rear) anti-sway bars.I installed many nice accessories that enhance the truck's looks and coziness;(I.e.


kia sorento
1 17" Colorado wheels and new tires; interior wood package; top quality floor mats; bra; dash topper... etc.Next it will be the aforementioned Air Shocks and anti-sway bars.In summary, I bought this truck for its looks!


kia sorento
1 I think it is the nicest looking mid size on the market.If you are not in a hurry, cruise at 63 MPH OR at 5 MPH below the traffic flow.You'll save gas and enjoy this beautiful truck, which lines I could not resist...In all fairness to the reader, it is too early to speak of the truck's long-term performance and reliability."

kia sorento
2 This is the first truck I've ever bought.


kia sorento
2 Though I've only had it for less than a year, I absolutley love it.


kia sorento
2 I've driven other trucks which prompted me to purchase the Colorado.


kia sorento
1 The other trucks were too small or big, not enough power or very little.


kia sorento
1 Even trucks that fell into the same class as the Colorado didn't make me feel too comfortable behind the wheel (the seats were not very friendly to the back and the steering wheel was just not positioned right) and had lousy handling.


kia sorento
1 I have the 4-dr.

1 crew cab with the 3.7L VORTEC in-line five-cylinder engine.

kia sorento
2 It is fast, dependable and FUN to drive.


kia sorento
1 It's just...well, plain.


kia sorento
1 But that's just me being too picky.


kia sorento
2 I've also purchased the tonneau soft cover (which took less than 25 minutes to assemble - even for someone like me that has never assembled one before) and the 5'1" rubber bed mat.

2 It kept keeping eating my CDs; I really took offense when it wouldn't give back the Grateful Dead!


kia sorento
2 Now the stereo sound is goofy.


kia sorento
1 I don't think the sound system was hooked up correctly the last time.


kia sorento
2 After using the vehicle, I have decided the back is too small for people to actually sit in and is only good for storage.


kia sorento
1 If children sit in back it is dangerous because their heads hit the window as there are no head rests.


kia sorento
1 Not good.


kia sorento
1 In the beginning I was in at the dealership dropping the truck off 2-3 times a month the first year and a half.


kia sorento

kia soul
2 I bought a black 2012 TL after a lot of research, lots of test drives, and most importantly a lot of analysis and this was the most value I could get for my money.

kia sorento

kia sorento
1 I was told the factory doesn't install the passenger side key slot and the feature is not available.


kia sorento
2 When the truck is paid off I will have the dealership fix the truck once more, and then quickly drive it to the sales department and trade it in, for a DODGE or a FORD! ; ) Then the sales staff can send this truck to service to fix it everytime it's driven over a speed bump.

1 The frame has always creaked (no dealer explanation), the bolt holding the drivers seat belt sheared off at the floor, the front window wasn't sealed properly resulting in a puddle of water on the floor, there is some kind of wire that has broken under the driver seatback that can be easily felt, the tire jack was so cheaply made that it broke the first time it was used, there was a rattle in the dash from a bolt that wasn't properly fastened and now we are being told that there seems to be a problem (maybe) with the timing cover seal (read: head gasket, ie.

1 This truck for me is the perfect size.


kia soul
1 It is very spacious and for a 6 foot 3 inches guy like me, I find it extremely comfortable.I love the new look for the 2012 TL and the gas mileage is not that bad either gives me 24 on an average in the city and in near perfect driving conditions there have been instances where it gave me 32 as well.Things that could be added on or even given as additional options to choose from in the future models could be side view cameras and some more ambient color options, and touch screen and advanced options like lane departure system and intelligent cruise control and that would put the TL right there at the top of the line with nothing else to complain about.On the whole the car is a very smooth ride with very good exterior features and great comfort.

1 When I started looking at trucks over two years ago, I went to a car show and was able to compare them side by side.


kia sorento
2 The Toyotas had flemsy sheet medal and I did not want another vehicle with those fabric timing belts, so I want I was impressed with the Colorado styling and the chain-drive 5 cylinder engine.When I went for a test drive, I found the cab to be spacous and comfortable for my 6 foot person.The handling does not compare to a sports car, but very good for a truck chasis.


kia sorento
2 While traveling briskly over some washboard, pot-holed forest service roads, I was particularly impressed with was the agility with which the truck glided over the dirt and gravel...Chevy did a good job on the truck suspension.The Colorado is rated for towing 4,000lbs and I have easily towed a 2,000lb load.

1 However, the 4cyl Automatic shifts frequently on hilly terrain, unless you're running @ 65+ mph otherwise the rpm is too low on the torque curve to pull the hills in Overdrive so now I just shift into 3rd gear to avoid frequent shifts under those conditions which will hopefully extend transmission life.

1 The 3.7L I-5 engine may have been a better choice but that would have been a $2K difference in price under the C-4-C rebate program, which will pay for a lot of gas so I opted for the standard 2.9L I4 engine, which has plenty of power for most of my driving needs.

2 While traveling briskly over some washboard, pot-holed forest service roads, I was particularly impressed with was the agility with which the truck glided over the dirt and gravel...Chevy did a good job on the truck suspension.The Colorado is rated for towing 4,000lbs and I have easily towed a 2,000lb load.
